<p style=' font-size:1.2em;'>PREFACE.</p>
</div>

<p>To the lovers of thrilling adventure, the title of this
work would alone be its strongest recommendation. The
exploits of the Heroes of the West, need but a simple
narration to give them an irresistible charm. They display
the bolder and rougher features of human nature in
their noblest light, softened and directed by virtues that
have appeared in the really heroic deeds of every age,
and form pages in the history of this country destined to
be read and admired when much that is now deemed more
important is forgotten.</p>
<p>It is true, that, with the lights of this age, we regard
many of the deeds of our western pioneer as aggressive,
barbarous, and unworthy of civilized men. But there is
no truly noble heart that will not swell in admiration of
the devotion and disinterestedness of Benjamin Logan, the
self-reliant energy of Boone and Whetzel, and the steady
firmness and consummate military skill of George Rogers
Clarke. The people of this country need records of the
lives of such men, and we have attempted to present these
in an attractive form.</p>

<p>In all notices of border life, the name of Daniel Boone appears first&mdash;as
the hero and the father of the west. In him were united those
qualities which make the accomplished frontiersman&mdash;daring, activity,
and circumspection, while he was fitted beyond most of his contemporary
borderers to lead and command.</p>
<p>Daniel Boone was born either in Virginia or Pennsylvania,
and at an early age settled in North Carolina, upon
the banks of the Yadkin. In 1767, James Findley, the
first white man who ever visited Kentucky, returned to the
settlements of North Carolina, and gave such a glowing
account of that wilderness, that Boone determined to venture
into it, on a hunting expedition. Accordingly, in
1769, accompanied by Findley and four others, he commenced
his journey. Kentucky was found to be all that
the first adventurer had represented, and the hunters had
fine sport. The country was uninhabited, but, during certain
seasons, parties of the northern and southern Indians
visited it upon hunting expeditions. These parties frequently
engaged in fierce conflicts, and hence the beautiful
region was known as the &#8220;dark and bloody ground.&#8221;</p>

BATTLE OF BLUE LICKS.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On the 22d of December, 1769, Boone and one of his
companions, named John Stuart, left their encampment
on the Red river, and boldly followed a buffalo path far
into the forest. While roving carelessly from canebrake
to canebrake, they were suddenly alarmed by the appearance
of a party of Indians, who, springing from their
place of concealment, rushed upon them with a swiftness
which rendered escape impossible. The hunters were
seized, disarmed, and made prisoners. Under these terrible
circumstances, Boone&#8217;s presence of mind was admirable.
He saw that there was no chance of immediate
escape; but he encouraged his companion and constrained
himself to follow the Indians in all their movements, with
so constrained an air, that their vigilance began to relax.</p>

DANIEL BOONE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On the seventh evening of the captivity of the hunter,
the party encamped in a thick cane-break, and having
built a large fire lay down to rest. About midnight, Boone,
who had not closed his eyes, ascertained from the deep
breathing of all around him, that the whole party, including
Stuart, was in a deep sleep. Gently extricating himself
from the savages who lay around him, he awoke Stuart,
informed him of his determination to escape, and exhorted
him to follow without noise. Stuart obeyed with quickness
and silence. Rapidly moving through the forest, guided
by the light of the stars and the barks of the trees, the
hunters reached their former camp the next day, but found
it plundered and deserted, with nothing remaining to show
the fate of their companions. Soon afterwards, Stuart
was shot and scalped, and Boone and his brother who had
come into the wilderness from North Carolina, were left
alone in the forest. Nay, for several months, Daniel had
not a single companion, for his brother returned to North
Carolina for ammunition. The hardy hunter was exposed
to the greatest dangers, but he contrived to escape them all.
In 1771, Boone and his brother returned to North Carolina,
and Daniel, having sold what property he could not take
with him, determined to take his family to Kentucky, and
make a settlement. He was joined by others at &#8220;Powel&#8217;s
Valley,&#8221; and commenced the journey, at the head of a considerable
party of pioneers. Being attacked by the Indians,
the adventurers were compelled to return, and it
was not until 1774, that the indomitable Boone succeeded
in conveying his family to the banks of the Kentucky,
and founding Boonesborough. In the meantime, James
Harrod had settled at the station called Harrodsburgh.
Other stations were founded by Bryant and Logan&mdash;daring
pioneers; but Boonesborough was the chief object of
Indian hostility, and was exposed to almost incessant attack,
from its foundation until after the bloody battle of
Blue Licks. During this time, Daniel Boone was regarded
as the chief support and counsellor of the settlers, and in
all emergencies, his wisdom and valor was of the greatest
service. He met with many adventures, and made some
hair-breadth escapes, but survived all his perils and hardships
and lived to a green old age, enjoying the respect
and confidence of a large and happy community, which
his indomitable spirit had been chiefly instrumental in
founding. He never lost his love of the woods and the
chase, and within a few weeks of his death might have
been seen, rifle in hand, eager in the pursuit of game.</p>

<h2>Simon Kenton.</h2>
</div>

<p>Simon Kenton was born in Fauquier county, Virginia,
on the 15th of May, 1755. His parents were poor, and
until the age of sixteen his days seem to have been passed
in the laborious drudgery of a farm. When he was about
sixteen, an unfortunate occurrence threw him upon his
own resources. A robust young farmer, named Leitchman,
and he were rival suitors for the hand of a young
coquette, and she being unable to decide between them,
they took the matter into their own hands and fought a
regular pitched battle at a solitary spot in the forest.
After a severe struggle, Kenton triumphed, and left his
antagonist upon the ground, apparently in the agonies of
death. Without returning for a suit of clothing, the
young conqueror fled westward, assumed the name of
Butler, joined a party of daring hunters, and visited
Kentucky, (1773.) In the wilderness he became an accomplished
and successful hunter and spy, but suffered
many hardships.</p>
<p>In 1774, the Indian war, occasioned by the murder of
the family of the chief, Logan, broke out, and Kenton
entered the service of the Virginians as a spy, in which
capacity he acted throughout the campaign, ending with
the battle of Point Pleasant. He then explored the country
on both sides of the Ohio, and hunted in company
with a few other, in various parts of Kentucky. When
Boonesborough was attacked by a large body of Indians,
Simon took an active part in the defence, and in several
of Boone&#8217;s expeditions, our hero served as a spy, winning
a high reputation.</p>
<p>In the latter part of 1777, Kenton, having crossed the
Ohio, on a horse-catching expedition, was overtaken and
made captive by the Indians. Then commenced a series
of tortures to which the annals of Indian warfare, so deeply
tinged with horrors, afford few parallels. Having kicked
and cuffed him, the savages tied him to a pole, in a
very painful position, where they kept him till the next
morning, then tied him on a wild colt and drove it swiftly
through the woods to Chilicothe. Here he was tortured
in various ways. The savages then carried him to Pickaway,
where it was intended to burn him at the stake, but
from this awful death, he was saved through the influence
of the renegade, Simon Girty, who had been his early
friend. Still, Kenton was carried about from village to
village, and tortured many times. At length, he was
taken to Detroit, an English post, where he was well-treated;
and he recovered from his numerous wounds. In
the summer of 1778, he succeeded in effecting his escape,
and, after a long march, reached Kentucky.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Kenton was engaged in all the Indian expeditions up
to Wayne&#8217;s decisive campaign, in 1794, and was very
serviceable as a spy. Few borderers had passed through
so many hardships, and won so bright a reputation. He
lived to a very old age, and saw the country, in which he
had fought and suffered, formed into the busy and populous
state of Ohio. In his latter days, he was very poor,
and, but for the kindness of some distinguished friends,
would have wanted for the necessaries of life.</p>

<h2>George Rogers Clarke.</h2>
</div>

<p>In natural genius for military command, few men of
the west have equalled George Rogers Clarke. The conception
and execution of the famous expedition against
Kaskaskia and Vincennes displayed many of those qualities
for which the best generals of the world have been
eulogized, and would have done honor to a Clive.</p>
<p>Clarke was born in Albermarle county, Virginia, in
September, 1753. Like Washington, he engaged, at an
early age, in the business of land surveying, and was fond
of several branches of mathematics. On the breaking out
of Dunmore&#8217;s war, Clarke took command of a company,
and fought bravely at the battle of Point Pleasant, being
engaged in the only active operation of the right wing of
the Virginians against the Indians. Peace was concluded
soon after, by Lord Dunmore, and Clarke, whose gallant
bearing had been noticed, was offered a commission in the
royal service. But this he refused, as he apprehended
that his native country would soon be at war with Great
Britain.</p>

GEORGE ROGERS CLARKE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Early in 1775, Clarke visited Kentucky as the favorite
scene of adventure, and penetrated to Harrodsburgh. His
talents were immediately appreciated by the Kentuckians,
and he was placed in command of all the irregular troops
in that wild region. In 1776, the young commander exerted
himself with extraordinary ability to secure a political
organization and the means of defence to Kentucky,
and was so successful as to win the title of the founder of
the commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
<p>In partisan service against the Indians, Clarke was active
and efficient; but his bold and comprehensive mind looked
to checking savage inroads at their sources. He saw at
a glance, that the red men were stimulated to outrages by
the British garrisons of Detroit, Vincennes and Kaskaskia,
and was satisfied that to put an end to them, those posts
must be captured. Having sent two spies to reconnoitre
Kaskaskia and Vincennes, and gained considerable intelligence
of the situation of the enemy, the enterprising commander
sought aid from the government of Virginia to
enable him to carry out his designs. After some delay,
money, supplies, and a few companies of troops were obtained.
Clarke then proceeded to Corn Island, opposite
the present city of Louisville. Here the objects of the
expedition were disclosed. Some of the men murmured,
and others attempted to desert; but the energy of Colonel
Clarke secured obedience and even enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The little band soon commenced its march through a
wild and difficult country, and on the 4th of July, 1778,
reached a spot within a few miles of the town of Kaskaskia.
Clarke made his arrangements for a surprise with
great skill and soon after dark, the town was captured
without shedding a drop of blood. The inhabitants were
at first terror-stricken and expected to be massacred, but
they were soon convinced of their mistake by the bearing
and representations of the Virginia commander. Cahokia
was captured shortly afterwards, without difficulty.</p>
<p>Clarke&#8217;s situation was now extremely critical, and he
duly appreciated the fact. Vincennes was still in front,
so garrisoned, that it seemed madness to attempt its capture
by direct attack. But a bold offensive movement
could alone render the conquests which had been made,
permanent and advantageous. A French priest, named
Gibault, secured the favor of the inhabitants of Vincennes
for the American interest, and the Indians of the neighborhood
were conciliated by the able management of Colonel
Clarke, who knew how to win the favor of the men
better than any other borderer; but on the 29th of January,
1779, intelligence was received at Kaskaskia, where
Clarke was then posted, that Governor Hamilton had taken
possession of Vincennes, and meditated the re-capture of
the other posts, preparatory to assailing the whole frontier,
as far as Fort Pitt.</p>

BATTLE OF POINT PLEASANT.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Clarke determined to act upon the offensive immediately,
as his only salvation. Mounting a galley with two four-pounders
and four swivels, and manning it with forty-six
men, he dispatched it up the Wabash, to the White
River, and on the 7th of February, 1779, marched from
Kaskaskia at the head of only one hundred and seventy
men, over the drowned lands of the Wabash, against the
British post. The march of Arnold by way of the Kennebec
to Canada can alone be placed as a parallel with this
difficult expedition. The indomitable spirit of Clarke sustained
the band through the most incredible fatigues. On
the 28th the expedition approached the town, still undiscovered.
The American commander then issued a proclamation,
intended to produce an impression that his force
was large and confident of success, and invested the fort.
So vigorously was the siege prosecuted that the garrison
was reduced to straits, and Governor Hamilton compelled
to capitulate. (24th of February, 1779.) This was a
brilliant achievement and reflected the highest honor upon
Colonel Clarke and his gallant band. Detroit was now in
full view, and Clarke was confident he could capture it if
he had but five hundred men; but he could not obtain
that number, till the chances of success were annihilated,
and thus his glorious expedition terminated. The object
of the enterprise, however, which was the checking of Indian
depredations, was accomplished. Clarke afterwards
engaged in other military enterprises and held high civil
offices in Kentucky; but at the capture of Vincennes his
fame reached its greatest brilliancy, and posterity will not
willingly let it die.</p>

<h2>Benjamin Logan.</h2>
</div>

<p>The real heroic spirit, which delights in braving the
greatest dangers in the cause of humanity, was embodied
in Benjamin Logan, one of the first settlers in Kentucky.
This distinguished borderer was born in Augusta county,
Virginia. At an early age he displayed the noble impulses
of his heart; for upon the death of his father,
when the laws of Virginia allowed him, as the eldest son,
the whole property of the intestate, he sold the farm and
distributed the money among his brothers and sisters, reserving
a portion for his mother. At the age of twenty-one,
Logan removed to the banks of the Holston, where
he purchased a farm, and married. He served in Dunmore&#8217;s
war. In 1775, he removed to Kentucky, and soon
became distinguished among the hardy frontiersmen for
firmness, prudence, and humanity. In the following year
he returned for his family, and brought them to a small
settlement called Logan&#8217;s Fort, not far from Harrodsburgh.</p>

LOGAN JOURNEYING INTO KENTUCKY.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On the morning of the 20th of May, 1777, the women
were milking the cows at the gate of the little fort, and
some of the garrison attending them, when a party of
Indians appeared and fired at them. One man was shot
dead, and two more wounded, one of them mortally. The
whole party instantly ran into the fort, and closed the
gate. The enemy quickly showed themselves at the edge
of the canebrake, within rifle-shot of the gate, and seemed
numerous and determined. A spectacle was now presented
to the garrison which awakened interest and compassion.
A man, named Harrison, had been severely
wounded, and still lay near the spot where he had fallen.
The poor fellow strove to crawl towards the fort, and succeeded
in reaching a cluster of bushes, which, however,
were too thin to shelter his person from the enemy. His
wife and children in the fort were in deep distress at his
situation. The case was one to try the hearts of men.
The numbers of the garrison were so small, that it was
thought folly to sacrifice any more lives in striving to
save one seemingly far spent. Logan endeavored to persuade
some of the men to accompany him in a sally; but
the danger was so appalling that only one man, John
Martin, could be induced to make the attempt. The gate
was opened, and the two sallied forth, Logan leading the
way. They had advanced about five steps, when Harrison
made a vigorous attempt to rise, and Martin, supposing
him able to help himself, sprang back within the gate.
Harrison fell at full-length upon the grass. Logan paused
a moment after the retreat of Martin, then sprang forward
to the spot where Harrison lay, seized the wounded
man in his arms, and in spite of a tremendous shower of
balls poured from every side, reached the fort without receiving
a scratch, though the gate and picketing near
him were riddled and his clothes pierced in several places.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the heroic Logan again performed an
act of self-devotion. The fort was vigorously assailed,
and although the little garrison made a brave defence,
their destruction seemed imminent, on account of the
scarcity of ammunition. Holston was the nearest point
where supplies could be obtained. But who would brave
so many dangers in the attempt to procure it? No one
but Logan. After encouraging his men to hope for his
speedy return, he crawled through the Indian encampment
on a dark night, proceeded by by-paths, which no white
man had then trodden, reached Holston, obtained a supply
of powder and lead, returned by the same almost inaccessible
paths, and got safe within the walls of the fort.
The garrison was inspired with fresh courage, and in a
few days, the appearance of Colonel Bowman, with a body
of troops, compelled the savages to retire.</p>
<p>Logan led several expeditions into the Indian country,
and won a high renown as one of the boldest and most
successful of Kentucky&#8217;s heroes. When the Indian depredations
were, in a great measure, checked, he devoted
himself to civil affairs, and exerted considerable influence
upon the politics of the country. Throughout his career,
he was beloved and respected as a fearless, honest, and
intelligent man.</p>

<h2>Samuel Brady.</h2>
</div>

<p>Captain Samuel Brady was the Daniel Boone of
Western Pennsylvania. As brave as a lion, as swift as a
deer, and as cautious as a panther, he gave the Indians
reason to tremble at the mention of his name. As the
captain of the rangers he was the favorite of General
Brodhead, the commander of the Pennsylvania forces,
and regarded by the frontier inhabitants as their eye
and arm.</p>
<p>The father and brother of Captain Brady being killed
by the Indians, it is said that our hero vowed to revenge
their murder, and never be at peace with the Indians of
any tribe. Many instances of such dreadful vows, made
in moments of bitter anguish, occur in the history of our
border, and, when we consider the circumstances, we can
scarcely wonder at the number, though, as Christians, we
should condemn such bloody resolutions.</p>

GENERAL BRODHEAD.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Many of Brady&#8217;s exploits are upon record; and they
are entitled to our admiration for their singular daring
and ingenuity. One of the most remarkable is known in
border history as Brady&#8217;s Leap. The energetic Brodhead,
by an expedition into the Indian country, had delivered
such destructive blows that the savages were quieted for
a time. The general kept spies out, however, for the
purpose of guarding against sudden attacks on the settlements.
One of the scouting parties, under the command
of Captain Brady, had the French creek country assigned
as their field of duty. The captain reached the waters
of Slippery Rock, without seeing any signs of Indians.
Here, however, he came on a trail, in the evening, which
he followed till dark, without overtaking the enemy. The
next morning the pursuit was renewed, and Brady overtook
the Indians while they were at their morning meal.
Unfortunately, another party of savages was in his rear,
and when he fired upon those in front, he was in turn
fired upon from behind. He was now between two fires,
and greatly outnumbered. Two of his men fell, his tomahawk
was shot from his side, and the enemy shouted for
the expected triumph. There was no chance of successful
defence in the position of the rangers, and they were
compelled to break and flee.</p>
<p>Brady ran towards the creek. The Indians pursued,
certain of making him captive, on account of the direction
he had taken. To increase their speed, they threw
away their guns, and pressed forward with raised tomahawk.
Brady saw his only chance of escape, which was
to leap the creek, afterwards ascertained to be twenty-two
feet wide and twenty deep. Determined never to fall
alive into the hands of the Indians, he made a mighty
effort, sprang across the abyss of waters and stood rifle in
hand upon the opposite bank. As quick as lightning, he
proceeded to load his rifle. A large Indian, who had been
foremost in pursuit, came to the opposite bank, and after
magnanimously doing justice to the captain by exclaiming
&#8220;Blady make good jump!&#8221; made a rapid retreat.</p>
<p>Brady next went to the place appointed as a rendezvous
for his party, and finding there three of his men, commenced
his homeward march, about half defeated. Three Indians
had been killed while at their breakfast. The savages did
not return that season, to do any injury to the whites, and
early in the fall, moved off to join the British, who had to
keep them during the winter, their corn having been destroyed
by General Brodhead. Brady survived all his
perils and hardships and lived to see the Indians completely
humbled before those whites on whom they had committed
so many outrages.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
<h2>Lewis Whetzel.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Whetzel family is remembered in the west for the
courage, resolution, and skill in border warfare displayed
by four of its members. Their names were Martin, Lewis,
Jacob, and John. Of these, Lewis won the highest renown,
and it is doubtful whether Boone, Brady, or Kenton
equaled him in boldness of enterprise.</p>
<p>In the hottest part of the Indian war, old Mr. Whetzel,
who was a German, built his cabin some distance from
the fort at Wheeling. One day, during the absence of
the two oldest sons, Martin and John, a numerous party
of Indians surrounded the house, killed, tomahawked and
scalped old Mr. Whetzel, his wife, and the small children,
and carried off Lewis, who was then about thirteen years
old, and Jacob who was about eleven. Before the young
captives had been carried far, Lewis contrived their escape.
When these two boys grew to be men, they took a solemn
oath never to make peace with the Indians as long as they
had strength to wield a tomahawk or sight to draw a bead,
and they kept their oath.</p>
<p>The appearance of Lewis Whetzel was enough to strike
terror into common men. He was about five feet ten inches
high, having broad shoulders, a full breast, muscular limbs,
a dark skin, somewhat pitted by the small pox, hair which,
when combed out, reached to the calves of his legs, and
black eyes, whose excited and vindictive glance would
curdle the blood. He excelled in all exercises of strength
and activity, could load his rifle while running with almost
the swiftness of a deer, and was so habituated to constant
action, that an imprisonment of three days, as ordered by
General Harmar, was nearly fatal to him. He had the
most thorough self-reliance as his long, solitary and perilous
expeditions into the Indian country prove.</p>

INDIAN CHIEF.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In the year of 1782, Lewis Whetzel went with Thomas
Mills, who had been in the campaign, to get a horse,
which he had left near the place where St. Clairsville now
stands. At the Indian Spring, two miles above St. Clairsville,
on the Wheeling road, they were met by about forty
Indians, who were in pursuit of the stragglers from the
campaign. The Indians and the white men discovered
each other about the same time. Lewis fired first, and
killed an Indian; the fire from the Indians wounded Mr.
Mills, and he was soon overtaken and killed. Four of
the Indians then singled out, dropped their guns, and
pursued Whetzel. Whetzel loaded his rifle as he ran.
After running about half a mile, one of the Indians having
got within eight or ten steps of him, Whetzel wheeled
round and shot him down, ran on, and loaded as before.
After going about three-quarters of a mile further, a second
Indian came so close to him, that when he turned to
fire, the Indian caught the muzzle of his gun, and as he
expressed it, he and the Indian had a severe wring for it;
he succeeded, however, in bringing the gun to the Indian&#8217;s
breast, and killed him on the spot. By this time, he, as
well as the Indians, were pretty well tired; the pursuit
was continued by the remaining two Indians. Whetzel,
as before, loaded his gun, and stopped several times during
the chase. When he did so the Indians treed themselves.
After going something more than a mile, Whetzel
took advantage of a little open piece of ground,
over which the Indians were passing, a short distance behind
him, to make a sudden stop for the purpose of shooting
the foremost, who got behind a little sapling, which
was too small to cover his body. Whetzel shot, and broke
his thigh; the wound, in the issue, proved fatal. The last
of the Indians then gave a little yell, and said, &#8220;No
catch dat man&mdash;gun always loaded,&#8221; and gave up the
chase; glad, no doubt, to get off with his life.</p>
<p>Another of this daring warrior&#8217;s exploits is worthy of
a place beside the most remarkable achievements of individual
valor. In the year 1787, a party of Indians crossed
the Ohio, killed a family, and scalped with impunity. This
murder spread great alarm through the sparse settlements
and revenge was not only resolved upon, but a handsome
reward was offered for scalps. Major McMahan, who often
led the borderers in their hardy expeditions, soon raised
a company of twenty men, among whom was Lewis Whetzel.
They crossed the Ohio and pursued the Indian trail
until they came to the Muskingum river. There the spies
discovered a large party of Indians encamped. Major
McMahan fell back a short distance, and held a conference
when a hasty retreat was resolved upon as the most prudent
course, Lewis Whetzel refused to take part in the
council, or join in the retreat. He said he came out to
hunt Indians; they were now found and he would either
lose his own scalp or take that of a &#8220;red skin.&#8221; All arguments
were thrown away upon this iron-willed man; he
never submitted to the advice or control of others. His
friends were compelled to leave him a solitary being surrounded
by vigilant enemies.</p>

LEWIS WHETZEL&#8217;S SINGULAR ESCAPE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as the major&#8217;s party had retired beyond the
reach of danger, Whetzel shouldered his rifle, and marched
off into a different part of the country, hoping that fortune
would place a lone Indian in his way. He prowled
through the woods like a panther, eager for prey, until
the next evening, when he discovered a smoke curling up
among the bushes. Creeping softly to the fire, he found
two blankets and a small copper kettle, and concluded
that it was the camp of two Indians. He concealed himself
in the thick brush, in such a position that he could
see the motions of the enemy. About sunset the two
Indians came in, cooked and ate their supper, and then sat
by the fire engaged in conversation. About nine o&#8217;clock
one of them arose, shouldered his rifle, took a chunk of
fire in his hand, and left the camp, doubtless in search of
a deer-lick. The absence of this Indian was a source of
vexation and disappointment to Whetzel, who had been so
sure of his prey. He waited until near break of day, and
still the expected one did not return. The concealed
warrior could delay no longer. He walked cautiously to
the camp, found his victim asleep, and drawing a knife
buried it in the red man&#8217;s heart. He then secured the
scalp, and set off for home, where he arrived only one day
after his companions. For the scalp, he claimed and
received the reward.</p>
<p>Here is another of Lewis Whetzel&#8217;s remarkable exploits.
Returning home from a hunt, north of the Ohio,
he was walking along in that reckless manner, which is a
consequence of fatigue, when his quick eye suddenly
caught sight of an Indian in the act of raising his gun to
fire. Both sprung like lightning to the woodman&#8217;s forts,
large trees, and there they stood for an hour, each afraid
of the other. This quiet mode of warfare did not suit
the restless Whetzel, and he set his invention to work to
terminate it. Placing his bear-skin cap on the end of
his ramrod, he protruded it slightly and cautiously as if
he was putting his head to reconnoitre, and yet was hesitating
in the venture. The simple savage was completely
deceived. As soon as he saw the cap, he fired and it fell.
Whetzel then sprang forward to the astonished red man,
and with a shot from the unerring rifle brought him to
the ground quite dead. The triumphant ranger then
pursued his march homeward.</p>
<p>But it was in a deliberate attack upon a party of four
Indians that our hero displayed the climax of daring and
resolution. While on a fall hunt, on the Muskingum, he
came upon a camp of four savages, and with but little
hesitation resolved to attempt their destruction. He concealed
himself till midnight, and then stole cautiously
upon the sleepers. As quick as thought, he cleft the
skull of one of them. A second met the same fate, and
as a third attempted to rise, confused by the horrid yells,
which Whetzel gave with his blows, the tomahawk stretched
him in death. The fourth Indian darted into the darkness
of the wood and escaped, although Whetzel pursued
him for some distance. Returning to camp, the ranger
scalped his victims and then left for home. When asked on
his return, &#8220;What luck?&#8221; he replied, &#8220;Not much. I treed
four Indians, and one got away.&#8221; Where shall we look for
deeds of equal daring and hardihood? Martin, Jacob,
and John Whetzel were bold warriors; and in the course
of the Indian war, they secured many scalps; but they
never obtained the reputation possessed by their brother,
Lewis. All must condemn cruelty wherever displayed,
but it is equally our duty to render just admiration to
courage, daring, and indomitable energy, qualities in which
the Whetzel brothers have rarely if ever been excelled.</p>

LEWIS WHETZEL&#8217;S STRATAGEM.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>General Clark, the companion of Lewis in the celebrated
tour across the Rocky Mountains, having heard much of
Lewis Whetzel, in Kentucky, determined to secure his
services for the exploring expedition. After considerable
hesitation, Whetzel consented to go, and accompanied the
party during the first three months&#8217; travel, but then declined
going any further, and returned home. Shortly
after this, he left again on a flat-boat, and never returned.
He visited a relation, named Sikes, living about twenty
miles in the interior, from Natchez, and there made his
home, until the summer of 1808, when he died, leaving a
fame for valor and skill in border warfare, which will not
be allowed to perish.</p>

<h2>Caffree, M&#8217;Clure, and Davis.</h2>
</div>

<p>About 1784, horse-stealing was as common as hunting
to the whites and Indians of the west. Thefts and reprisals
were almost constantly made. Some southern
Indians having stolen horses from Lincoln county, Kentucky,
three young men, named Caffree, M&#8217;Clure, and
Davis, set out in pursuit of them. Coming in sight of an
Indian town, near the Tennessee river, they met three
red men. The two parties made signs of peace, shook
hands, and agreed to travel together. Both were suspicious,
however, and at length, from various indications,
the whites became satisfied of the treacherous intentions
of the Indians, and resolved to anticipate then. Caffree
being a very powerful man, proposed that he himself
should seize one Indian, while Davis and M&#8217;Clure should
shoot the other two. Caffree sprang boldly upon the
nearest Indian, grasped his throat firmly, hurled him to
the ground, and drawing a cord from his pocket attempted
to tie him. At the same instant, Davis and M&#8217;Clure attempted
to perform their respective parts. M&#8217;Clure
killed his man, but Davis&#8217;s gun missed fire. All three,
<i>i. e.</i> the two white men, and the Indian at whom Davis
had flashed, immediately took trees, and prepared for a
skirmish, while Caffree remained upon the ground with the
captured Indian&mdash;both exposed to the fire of the others.
In a few seconds, the savage at whom Davis had flashed,
shot Caffree as he lay upon the ground and gave him a
mortal wound&mdash;and was instantly shot in turn by M&#8217;Clure
who had reloaded his gun. Caffree becoming very weak,
called upon Davis to come and assist him in tying the Indian,
and directly afterwards expired. As Davis was
running up to the assistance of his friend&mdash;the Indian released
himself, killed his captor, sprung to his feet,
and seizing Caffree&#8217;s rifle, presented it menacingly at
Davis, whose gun was not in order for service, and who
ran off into the forest, closely pursued by the Indian.
M&#8217;Clure hastily reloaded his gun and taking the rifle which
Davis had dropped, followed them for some distance into
the forest, making all signals which had been concerted
between them in case of separation. All, however, was
vain&mdash;he saw nothing more of Davis, nor could he ever
afterwards learn his fate. As he never returned to Kentucky,
however, he probably perished.</p>

A SOUTHERN INDIAN.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>M&#8217;Clure, finding himself alone in the enemy&#8217;s country,
and surrounded by dead bodies, thought it prudent to
abandon the object of the expedition and return to Kentucky.
He accordingly retraced his steps, still bearing
Davis&#8217; rifle in addition to his own. He had scarcely marched
a mile, before he saw advancing from the opposite direction,
an Indian warrior, riding a horse with a bell around
its neck, and accompanied by a boy on foot. Dropping
one of the rifles, which might have created suspicion,
M&#8217;Clure advanced with an air of confidence, extending his
hand and making other signs of peace. The opposite party
appeared frankly to receive his overtures, and dismounting,
seated himself upon a log, and drawing out his pipe, gave
a few puffs himself, and then handed it to M&#8217;Clure. In a
few minutes another bell was heard, at the distance of
half a mile, and a second party of Indians appeared upon
horseback. The Indian with M&#8217;Clure now coolly informed
him by signs that when the horseman arrived, he (M&#8217;Clure)
was to be bound and carried off as a prisoner with his feet
tied under the horse&#8217;s belly. In order to explain it more
fully, the Indian got astride of the log, and locked his legs
together underneath it. M&#8217;Clure, internally thanking the
fellow for his excess of candor, determined to disappoint
him, and while his enemy was busily engaged in riding
the log, and mimicking the actions of a prisoner, he very
quietly blew his brains out, and ran off into the woods. The
Indian boy instantly mounted the belled horse, and rode
off in an opposite direction. M&#8217;Clure was fiercely pursued
by several small Indian dogs, that frequently ran between
his legs and threw him down. After falling five or six
times, his eyes became full of dust and he was totally blind.
Despairing of escape, he doggedly lay upon his face, expecting
every instant to feel the edge of the tomahawk.
To his astonishment, however, no enemy appeared, and
even the Indian dogs after tugging at him for a few minutes,
and completely stripping him of his breeches, left
him to continue his journey unmolested. Finding every
thing quiet, in a few moments he arose, and taking up his
gun continued his march to Kentucky.</p>

<h2>Charles Johnston.</h2>
</div>

<p>In March, 1790 a boat, containing four men and two
women, passing down the Ohio, was induced by some
renegade whites to approach the shore, near the mouth
of the Sciota, and then attacked by a large party of Indians.
A Mr. John May and one of the women were
shot dead, and the others then surrendered. The chief
of the band was an old warrior, named Chickatommo, and
under his command were a number of renowned red men.
When the prisoners were distributed, a young man named
Charles Johnson, was given to a young Shawnee chief
who is represented to have been a noble character. His
name was Messhawa, and he had just reached the age
of manhood. His person was tall and seemingly rather
fitted for action than strength. His bearing was stately,
and his countenance expressive of a noble disposition. He
possessed great influence among those of his own tribe,
which he exerted on the side of humanity. On the
march, Messhawa repeatedly saved Johnson from the tortures
which the other savages delighted to inflict, and the
young captive saw some displays of generous exertion on
the part of the chief which are worthy of a place in border
history.</p>

MESSHAWA.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The warriors painted themselves in the most frightful
colors, and performed a war dance, with the usual accompaniments.
A stake, painted in alternate stripes of black
and vermilion, was fixed in the ground, and the dancers
moved in rapid but measured evolutions around it. They
recounted, with great energy, the wrongs they had received
from the whites.&mdash;Their lands had been taken from them&mdash;their
corn cut up&mdash;their villages burnt&mdash;their friends
slaughtered&mdash;every injury which they had received was
dwelt upon, until their passions had become inflamed beyond
control. Suddenly, Chickatommo darted from the
circle of dancers, and with eyes flashing fire, ran up to
the spot where Johnston was sitting, calmly contemplating
the spectacle before him. When within reach he struck
him a furious blow with his fist, and was preparing to repeat
it, when Johnston seized him by the arms, and hastily
demanded the cause of such unprovoked violence.
Chickatommo, grinding his teeth with rage, shouted
&#8220;Sit down, sit down!&#8221; Johnston obeyed, and the Indian,
perceiving the two children within ten steps of him,
snatched up a tomahawk, and advanced upon them with a
quick step, and a determined look. The terrified little
creatures instantly arose from the log on which they were
sitting, and fled into the woods, uttering the most piercing
screams, while their pursuer rapidly gained upon them
with uplifted tomahawk. The girl, being the youngest,
was soon overtaken, and would have been tomahawked,
had not Messhawa bounded like a deer to her relief. He
arrived barely in time to arrest the uplifted tomahawk
of Chickatommo, after which, he seized him by the collar
and hurled him violently backward to the distance of
several paces. Snatching up the child in his arms, he
then ran after the brother, intending to secure him likewise
from the fury of his companion, but the boy, misconstruing
his intention, continued his flight with such rapidity,
and doubled several times with such address, that
the chase was prolonged to the distance of several hundred
yards. At length Messhawa succeeded in taking
him. The boy, thinking himself lost, uttered a wild cry,
which was echoed by his sister, but both were instantly
calmed. Messhawa took them in his arms, spoke to them
kindly, and soon convinced them that they had nothing
to fear from him. He quickly reappeared, leading them
gently by the hand, and soothing them in the Indian language,
until they both clung to him closely for protection.</p>
<p>No other incident disturbed the progress of the ceremonies,
nor did Chickatommo appear to resent the violent
interference of Messhawa.</p>

<p>After undergoing many hardships, Johnston was taken
to Sandusky, where he was ransomed by a French trader.
Messhawa took leave of his young captive with many
expressions of esteem and friendship. This noble chief
was in the battle of the Fallen Timber and afterwards became
a devoted follower of the great Tecumseh&mdash;thus
proving that while he was as humane as a civilized man,
he was patriotic and high-spirited enough to resent the
wrongs of his people. He was killed at the battle of the
Thames, where the power of the Shawnees was for ever
crushed.</p>

<h2>Joseph Logston.</h2>
</div>

<p>Big Joe Logston was a noted character in the early
history of the west. He was born and reared among the
Alleghany mountains, near the source of the north branch
of the Potomac, some twenty or thirty miles from any
settlement. He was tall, muscular, excelled in all the
athletic sports of the border, and was a first-rate shot.
Soon after Joe arrived at years of discretion, his parents
died, and he went out to the wilds of Kentucky. There,
Indian incursions compelled him to take refuge in a fort.
This pent up life was not at all to Joe&#8217;s taste. He soon
became very restless, and every day insisted on going out
with others to hunt up cattle. At length no one would
accompany him, and he resolved to go out alone. He rode
the greater part of the day without finding any cattle,
and then concluded to return to the fort. As he was
riding along, eating some grapes, with which he had filled
his hat, he heard the reports of the two rifles; one ball
passed through the paps of his breast, which were very
prominent, and the other struck the horse behind the
saddle, causing the beast to sink in its tracks.</p>

INDIANS AMBUSHED FOR JOE LOGSTON.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Joe was on his feet in an instant and might have taken
to his heels with the chances of escape greatly in his favor.
But to him flight was never agreeable. The moment the
guns were fired, an Indian sprang forward with an uplifted
tomahawk; but as Joe raised his rifle, the savage jumped
behind two saplings, and kept springing from one to the
other to cover his body. The other Indian was soon discovered
behind a tree loading his gun. When in the act
of pushing down his bullet, he exposed his hips and Joe
fired a load into him. The first Indian then sprang forward
and threw his tomahawk at the head of the white
warrior, who dodged it. Joe then clubbed his gun and
made at the savage, thinking to knock him down. In
striking, he missed, and the gun now reduced to the naked
barrel, flew out of his hands. The two men then sprang
at each other with no other weapons than those of nature.
A desperate scuffle ensued. Joe could throw the Indian
down, but could not hold him there. At length, however,
by repeated heavy blows, he succeeded in keeping him
down, and tried to choke him with the left hand while he
kept the right free for contingencies. Directly, Joe saw
the savage trying to draw a knife from its sheath, and
waiting till it was about half way out, he grasped it quickly
and sank it up to the handle in the breast of his foe, who
groaned and expired.</p>
<p>Springing to his feet, Joe saw the Indian he had crippled,
propped against a log, trying to raise his gun to fire, but
falling forward, every time he made the attempt. The
borderer, having enough of fighting for one day, and not
caring to be killed by a crippled Indian, made for the fort,
where he arrived about nightfall. He was blood and dirt
from crown to toe, and without horse, hat, or gun.</p>
<p>The next morning a party went to Joe&#8217;s battle-ground.
On looking round, they found a trail, as if something had
been dragged away, and at a little distance they came
upon the big Indian, covered up with leaves. About a
hundred yards farther, they found the Indian Joe had
crippled, lying on his back, with his own knife sticking up
to the hilt in his body, just below the breast bone, evidently
to show that he had killed himself. Some years after this
fight, Big Joe Logston lost his life in a contest with a gang
of outlaws. He was one of those characters who were necessary
to the settlement of the west, but who would not
have been highly esteemed in civilized society.</p>

<a name='JESSE_HUGHES' id='JESSE_HUGHES'></a>
<h2>Jesse Hughes.</h2>
</div>

<p>Jesse Hughes was born and reared in Clarksburgh,
Harrison county, Virginia, on the head-waters of the Monongahela.
He was a light-built, active man, and from
his constant practice became one of the best hunters and
Indian fighters on the frontier. Having a perfect knowledge
of all the artifices of the Indians, he was quick to
devise expedients to frustrate them. Of this, the following
exploit is an illustration. At a time of great danger
from Indian incursions, when the citizens in the neighborhood
where in a fort at Clarksburgh, Hughes one
morning observed a lad very hurriedly engaged in fixing
his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what are you doing that for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to shoot a turkey that I hear gobbling on
the hill side,&#8221; replied Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear no turkey,&#8221; said Hughes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;There, didn&#8217;t you hear it?
Listen again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hughes, after hearing it repeated, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go and kill it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s my turkey. I heard it first,&#8221;
said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hughes, &#8220;but you know I am the best
marksman; and besides, I don&#8217;t want the turkey, you
may have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad then agreed that Hughes should go and kill it
for him. Hughes went out of the fort on the side that
was farthest from the supposed turkey, and running along
the river, went up a ravine and came in on the rear, where,
as he expected, he saw an Indian, sitting on a chestnut
stump, surrounded by sprouts, gobbling and watching to
see if any one would come from the fort to kill the turkey.
Hughes crept up and shot him dead. The successful
ranger then took off the scalp, and went into the fort,
where Jim was waiting for the prize.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;you have let the turkey
go. I would have killed it if I had gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hughes, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t let it go,&#8221; and he threw
down the scalp. &#8220;There, take your turkey, Jim; I don&#8217;t
want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad nearly fainted, as he thought of the death he
had so narrowly escaped, owing to the keen perception
and good management of Mr. Hughes.</p>
<p>The sagacity of our border hero was fully proved upon
another occasion. About 1790, the Indians visited
Clarksburgh, in the night, and contrived to steal a few
horses, with which they made a hasty retreat. About
daylight the next morning, a party of twenty-five or thirty
men, among whom was Jesse Hughes, started in pursuit.
They found a trail just outside of the settlement, and from
the signs, supposed that the marauding party consisted
of eight or ten Indians. A council was held to determine
how the pursuit should be continued. Mr. Hughes was
opposed to following the trail. He said he could pilot the
party to the spot where the Indians would cross the Ohio,
by a nearer way than the enemy could go, and thus render
success certain. But the captain of the party insisted on
following the trail. Mr. Hughes then pointed out the
dangers of such a course. Suddenly, the captain, with
unreasonable obstinacy, called aloud to those who were
brave to follow him and let the cowards go home. Hughes
knew the captain&#8217;s remark was intended for him, but
smothered his indignation and went on with the party.</p>
<p>They had not pursued very far when the trail went down
a drain, where the ridge on one side was very steep, with
a ledge of rocks for a considerable distance. On the top
of the cliff, two Indians lay in ambush, and when the
company got opposite to them, they made a noise, which
caused the whites to stop; that instant two of the company
were mortally wounded, and before the rangers
could get round to the top of the cliff, the Indians made
their escape with ease. This was as Hughes had predicted.
All then agreed that the plan rejected by the
captain was the best, and urged Hughes to lead them to
the Ohio river. This he consented to do, though fearful
that the Indians would cross before he could reach
the point. Leaving some of the company to take care
of the wounded men, the party started, and arrived at
the Ohio the next day, about an hour after the Indians
had crossed. The water was yet muddy in the horses&#8217;
trails, and the rafts that the red men had used were
floating down the opposite shore. The company was
now unanimous for returning home. Hughes said he
wanted to find out who the cowards were. He said that
if any of them would go with him, he would cross the
river, and scalp some of the Indians. Not one could be
found to accompany the daring ranger, who thus had full
satisfaction for the captain&#8217;s insult. He said he would go
by himself, and take a scalp, or leave his own with the
savages. The company started for home, and Hughes
went up the river three or four miles, then made a raft,
crossed the river, and camped for the night. The next
day, he found the Indian trail, pursued it very cautiously,
and about ten miles from the Ohio, came upon the camp.
There was but one Indian in it; the rest were all out
hunting. The red man was seated, singing, and playing
on some bones, made into a rude musical instrument,
when Hughes crept up and shot him. The ranger then
took the scalp, and hastened home in triumph, to tell his
adventures to his less daring companions.</p>

<a name='SIEGE_OF_FORT_HENRY' id='SIEGE_OF_FORT_HENRY'></a>
<h2>Siege of Fort Henry.</h2>
</div>

<p>The siege of Fort Henry, at the mouth of Wheeling
creek, in the year 1777, is one of the most memorable
events in Indian warfare&mdash;remarkable for the indomitable
bravery displayed by the garrison in general, and for
some thrilling attendant incidents. The fort stood immediately
on the left bank of the Ohio river, about a quarter
of a mile above Wheeling creek, and at much less distance
from an eminence which rises abruptly from the
bottom land. The space inclosed was about three quarters
of an acre. In shape the fort was a parallelogram, having
a block-house at each corner with lines of pickets eight
feet high between. Within the inclosures was a store-house,
barrack-rooms, garrison-well, and a number of cabins for
the use of families. The principal entrance was a gateway
on the eastern side of the fort. Much of the adjacent land
was cleared and cultivated, and near the base of the hill
stood some twenty-five or thirty cabins, which form the
rude beginning of the present city of Wheeling. The fort
is said to have been planned by General George Rogers
Clarke; and was constructed by Ebenezer Zane and John
Caldwell. When first erected, it was called Fort Fincastle
but the name was afterwards changed in compliment to
Patrick Henry the renowned orator and patriotic governor
of Virginia.</p>
<p>At the time of the commencement of the siege, the garrison
of Fort Henry numbered only forty-two men, some
of whom were enfeebled by age while others were mere boys.
All, however, were excellent marksmen, and most of them,
skilled in border warfare. Colonel David Shepherd, was a
brave and resolute officer in whom the borderers had full confidence.
The store-house was well-supplied with small arms,
particularly muskets, but sadly deficient in ammunition.</p>
<p>In the early part of September, 1777, it was ascertained
that a large Indian army was concentrating on the Sandusky
river, under the command of the bold, active, and
skilful renegade, Simon Girty. Colonel Shepherd had
many trusty and efficient scouts on the watch; but Girty
deceived them all and actually brought his whole force
of between four and five hundred Indians before Fort
Henry before his real object was discovered.</p>

PATRICK HENRY.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>On the 26th, an alarm being given all the inhabitants
in the vicinity repaired to the fort for safety. At break
of day, on the 27th, Colonel Shepherd, wishing to dispatch
an express to the nearest settlements for aid, sent a white
man and a negro to bring in some horses. While these
men were passing through the cornfield south of the fort,
they encountered a party of six Indians, one of whom
raised his gun and brought the white man to the ground.
The negro fled and reached the fort without receiving any
injury. As soon as he related his story, Colonel Shepherd
dispatched Captain Mason, with fourteen men, to dislodge
the Indians from the cornfield. Mason marched almost to the
creek without finding any Indians, and was about to return,
when he was furiously assailed in front, flank and rear by
the whole of Girty&#8217;s army. Of course, the little band was
thrown into confusion, but the brave captain rallied his
men, and taking the lead, hewed a passage through the
savage host. In the struggle, more than half of the party
were slain, and the gallant Mason severely wounded. An
Indian fired at the captain at the distance of five paces
and wounded, but did not disable him. Turning about,
he hurled his gun, felled the savage to the earth, and then
succeeded in hiding himself in a pile of fallen timbers, where
he was compelled to remain to the end of the siege. Only
two of his men survived the fight, and they owed their
safety to the heaps of logs and brush which abounded in
the cornfield.</p>
<p>As soon as the perilous situation of Captain Mason became
known at the fort, Captain Ogle was sent out with
twelve men, to cover his retreat. This party fell into an
ambuscade and two-thirds of the number were slain upon
the spot. Captain Ogle found a place of concealment,
where he was obliged to remain until the end of the siege.
Sergeant Jacob Ogle, though mortally wounded, managed
to escape, with two soldiers into the woods.</p>
<p>The Indian army now advanced to the assault, with
terrific yells. A few shots from the garrison, however,
compelled them to halt. Girty then changed the order
of attack. Parties of Indians were placed in such of the
village-houses as commanded a view of the block-houses.
A strong party occupied the yard of Ebenezer Zane, about
fifty yards from the fort, using a paling fence as a cover,
while the main force was posted under cover on the edge
of a cornfield to act as occasion might require.</p>
<p>Girty then appeared at the window of a cabin, with a
white flag in his hand, and demanded the surrender of
the fort in the name of his Britanic majesty. At this
time, the garrison numbered only twelve men and two
boys. Yet the gallant Colonel Shepherd promptly replied
to the summons, that the fort should never be surrendered
to the renegade. Girty renewed his proposition,
but before he could finish his harangue, a thoughtless
youth fired at the speaker and brought the conference to
an abrupt termination. Girty disappeared, and in about
fifteen minutes, the Indians opened a heavy fire upon the
fort, and continued it without much intermission for the
space of six hours. The fire of the little garrison, however,
was much more destructive than that of the assailants.
About one o&#8217;clock, the Indians ceased firing and
fell back against the base of the hill.</p>

THE ALARM AT FORT HENRY.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The colonel resolved to take advantage of the intermission
to send for a keg of powder, which was known to
be in the house of Ebenezer Zane, about sixty yards from
the fort. Several young men promptly volunteered for
this dangerous service; but Shepherd could only spare
one, and the young men could not determine who that
should be. At this critical moment, a young lady, sister
of Ebenezer Zane, came forward, and asked that she
might be permitted to execute the service; and so earnestly
did she argue for the proposition, that permission
was reluctantly granted. The gate was opened, and the
heroic girl passed out. The opening of the gate arrested
the attention of several Indians who were straggling
through the village, but they permitted Miss Zane to pass
without molestation. When she reappeared with the
powder in her arms, the Indians, suspecting the character
of her burden, fired a volley at her, but she reached the
fort in safety. Let the name of Elizabeth Zane be
remembered among the heroic of her sex.</p>
<p>About half-past two o&#8217;clock, the savages again advanced
and renewed their fire. An impetuous attack was
made upon the south side of the fort, but the garrison
poured upon the assailants a destructive fire from the two
lower block-houses. At the same time, a party of eighteen
or twenty Indians, armed with rails and billets of wood,
rushed out of Zane&#8217;s yard and made an attempt to force
open the gate of the fort. Five or six of the number were
shot down, and then the attempt was abandoned. The
Indians then opened a fire upon the fort from all sides,
except that next the river, which afforded no shelter to
besiegers. On the north and east the battle raged fiercely.
As night came on the fire of the enemy slackened. Soon
after dark, a party of savages advanced within sixty yards
of the fort, bringing a hollow maple log which they had
loaded to the muzzle and intended to use it as a cannon.
The match was applied and the wooden piece bursted,
killing or wounding several of those who stood near it.
The disappointed party then dispersed.</p>
<p>Late in the evening, Francis Duke, son-in-law of Colonel
Shepherd, arriving from the Forks of Wheeling, was
shot down before he could reach the fort. About four
o&#8217;clock next morning, Colonel Swearingen, with fourteen
men, arrived from Cross Creek, and was fortunate enough
to fight his way into the fort without losing a single man.</p>
<p>This reinforcement was cheering to the wearied garrison.
More relief was at hand. About daybreak,
Major Samuel M&#8217;Culloch, with forty mounted men from
Short Creek, arrived. The gate was thrown open, and
the men, though closely beset by the enemy, entered the
fort. But Major M&#8217;Culloch was not so fortunate. The
Indians crowded round and separated him from the
party. After several ineffectual attempts to force his
way to the gate, he turned and galloped off in the direction
of Wheeling Hill.</p>

DARING FEAT OF ELIZABETH ZANE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>When he was hemmed in by the Indians before the fort,
they might have taken his life without difficulty, but they
had weighty reasons for desiring to take him alive. From
the very commencement of the war, his reputation as an
Indian hunter was as great as that of any white man on
the north-western border. He had participated in so
many rencontres that almost every warrior possessed a
knowledge of his person. Among the Indians his name
was a word of terror; they cherished against him feelings
of the most phrenzied hatred, and there was not a Mingo
or Wyandotte chief before Fort Henry who would not have
given the lives of twenty of his warriors to secure to himself
the living body of Major M&#8217;Culloch. When, therefore,
the man whom they had long marked out as the first
object of their vengeance, appeared in their midst, they
made almost superhuman efforts to acquire possession of
his person. The fleetness of M&#8217;Culloch&#8217;s well-trained steed
was scarcely greater than that of his enemies, who, with
flying strides, moved on in pursuit. At length the hunter
reached the top of the hill, and, turning to the left, darted
along the ridge with the intention of making the best of
his way to Shor&#8217; creek. A ride of a few hundred yards
in that direction brought him suddenly in contact with a
party of Indians who were returning to their camp from a
marauding excursion to Mason&#8217;s Bottom, on the eastern
side of the hill. This party being too formidable in numbers
to encounter single-handed, the major turned his horse
about and rode over his own track, in the hope of discovering
some other avenue to escape. A few paces only of his
countermarch had been made, when he found himself confronted
by his original pursuers, who had, by this time,
gained the top of the ridge, and a third party was discovered
pressing up the hill directly on his right. He was
now completely hemmed in on three sides, and the fourth
was almost a perpendicular precipice of one hundred and
fifty feet descent, with Wheeling creek at its base. The
imminence of his danger allowed him but little time to
reflect upon his situation. In an instant he decided upon
his course. Supporting his rifle in his left hand and carefully
adjusting his reins with the other, he urged his horse
to the brink of the bluff, and then made the leap which decided
his fate. In the next moment the noble steed, still
bearing his intrepid rider in safety, was at the foot of the
precipice. M&#8217;Culloch immediately dashed across the creek,
and was soon beyond reach of the Indians.</p>
<p>After the escape of the major, the Indians concentrated
at the foot of the hill, and soon after set fire to all the
houses and fences outside of the fort, and killed about three
hundred cattle. They then raised the siege and retired.</p>
<p>The whole loss sustained by the whites during this remarkable
siege, was twenty-six men killed and four or five
wounded. The loss of the enemy was from sixty to one
hundred men. As they removed their dead, exact information
on the subject could not be obtained.</p>
<p>The gallant Colonel Shepherd deserved the thanks of
the frontier settlers for his conduct on this occasion, and
Governor Henry appointed him county lieutenant as a
token of his esteem. A number of females, who were in
the fort, undismayed by the dreadful strife, employed
themselves in running bullets and performing various little
services; and thus excited much enthusiasm among the
men. Perhaps, a more heroic band was never gathered
together in garrison than that which defended Fort Henry,
and it would be unjust to mention any one as particularly
distinguished. We have named the commander only because
of his position.</p>

<a name='SIMON_GIRTY' id='SIMON_GIRTY'></a>
<h2>Simon Girty.</h2>
</div>

<p>During the long warfare maintained between the pioneers
of the west and the Indians, the latter were greatly
assisted by some renegade white men. Of these, Simon
Girty was the most noted and influential. He led several
important expeditions against the settlements of Virginia
and Kentucky, displayed much courage, energy, and conduct,
and was the object of bitter hatred on the frontier.
Recent investigations into the stirring events of his career
have shown that however bad he might have been, much
injustice has been done his memory by border historians.</p>
<p>Simon Girty was born and reared in Western Pennsylvania,
near the Virginia line. His parents are said to
have been very dissipated, and this, perhaps, had some
influence in disgusting him with life in the settlements.
Becoming skilled in woodcraft, he served with young
Simon Kenton, as a scout upon the frontiers. He joined
the Virginia army in Dunmore&#8217;s wars, and, it is said,
showed considerable ambition to become distinguished as
a soldier. He was disappointed, and so far from gaining
promotion, was, for a trifling offence, publicly disgraced,
it is said, through the influence of Colonel Gibson. The
proud spirit of Girty could not brook such a blow. With
a burning thirst for revenge, he fled from the settlements,
and took refuge among the Wyandottes.</p>
<p>The talents of the renegade were of the kind and of the
degree to secure influence among the red men. He excelled
the majority of them in council and field, and neither
forgave a foe, nor forgot a friend. He was successful
in many expeditions after plunder and scalps, and spared
none because they were of his own race. He was cruel
as many of the borderers were cruel. Becoming an Indian,
he had an Indian&#8217;s hatred of the whites. The borderers
seldom showed a red man mercy, and they could
not expect any better treatment in return.</p>
<p>The exertions of Girty to save his friend, Simon Kenton,
from a horrible death, have been noticed in another place.
That he did not make such exertions more frequently on
the side of humanity is scarcely a matter of wonder&mdash;inasmuch
as he could not have done so consistently with
a due regard to his own safety. After he had become a
renegade, the borderers would not permit a return; and
as he was forced to reside among the Indians, he was
right in securing their favor. Besides saving Kenton, he
posted his brother, James Girty, upon the banks of the
Ohio, to warn passengers in boats not to be lured to the
shore by the arts of the Indians, or of the white men in
their service. This was a pure act of humanity. The
conduct of Girty on another memorable occasion, the
burning of Colonel William Crawford, was more suspicious.</p>

COLONEL CRAWFORD AND HIS FRIENDS, PRISONERS.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In the early part of the year 1782, the incursions of
the Indians became so harassing and destructive to the
inhabitants of Western Pennsylvania, that an expedition
against the Wyandotte towns was concerted, and the command
given to Colonel Crawford. On the 22d of May,
the army, consisting of four hundred and fifty men, commenced
its march, and proceeded due west as far as the
Moravian towns, where some of the volunteers deserted.
The main body, however, marched on, with unabated
spirit. The Indians, discovering the advance of the invaders
gathered a considerable force, and took up a strong
position, determined to fight. Crawford moved forward
in order of battle, and on the afternoon of the 6th of June,
encountered the enemy. The conflict continued fiercely
until night, when the Indians drew off, and Crawford&#8217;s
men slept on the field. In the morning, the battle was
renewed, but at a greater distance, and, during the day,
neither party suffered much. The delay, however, was
fatal to Crawford; for the Indians received large reinforcements.
As soon as it was dark, a council of war
was held, and it was resolved to retreat as rapidly as
possible. By nine o&#8217;clock, all the necessary arrangements
had been made, and the retreat began in good order.
After an advance of about a hundred yards, a firing was
heard in the rear, and the troops, seized with a panic,
broke and fled in confusion, each man trying to save himself.
The Indians came on rapidly in pursuit and plied
the tomahawk and scalping-knife without mercy. Colonel
Crawford and Dr. Knight were captured, at a distance
from the main body&mdash;which was soon dispersed in every
direction.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th of June, Crawford, Knight,
and nine other prisoners, were conducted to the old town
of Sandusky. The main body of the Indians halted within
eight miles of the village; but as Colonel Crawford expressed
great anxiety to speak with Simon Girty, who was
then at Sandusky, he was permitted to go under the care
of the Indians. On the morning of the 11th of June, the
colonel was brought back from Sandusky on purpose to
march into town with the other prisoners. To Knight&#8217;s
inquiry as to whether he had seen Girty, he replied in the
affirmative, and added, that the renegade had promised to
use his influence for the safety of the prisoners, though as
the Indians were much exasperated by the recent outrages
of the whites at Guadenhutten upon the unresisting Moravian
red men, he was fearful that all pleading would be
in vain.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/hhw044.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 322px; height: 598px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>Soon afterwards, Captain Pipe, the great chief of the
Delawares, appeared. This distinguished warrior had a
prepossessing appearance and bland manners, and his
language to the prisoners was kind. His purposes, however,
were bloody and revengeful. With his own hands
he painted every prisoner black! As they were conducted
towards the town, the captives observed the bodies of four
of their friends, tomahawked and scalped. This was regarded
as a sad presage. In a short time, they overtook
the five prisoners who remained alive. They were seated
on the ground, and surrounded by a crowd of Indian
squaws and boys, who taunted and menaced them. Crawford
and Knight were compelled to sit down apart from
the rest, and immediately afterwards the doctor was given
to a Shawnee warrior, to be conducted to their town. The
boys and squaws then fell upon the other prisoners, and
tomahawked them in a moment. Crawford was then
driven towards the village, Girty accompanying the party
on horseback.</p>
<p>Presently, a large fire was seen, around which were more
than thirty warriors, and about double that number of
boys and squaws. As soon as the colonel arrived, he was
stripped naked, and compelled to sit on the ground. The
squaws and boys then fell upon him, and beat him severely
with their fists and sticks. In a few minutes, a large
stake was fixed in the ground, and piles of hickory poles
were spread around it.</p>
<p>Colonel Crawford&#8217;s hands were then tied behind his
back; a strong rope was produced, one end of which was
fastened to the ligature between his wrists, and the other
tied to the bottom of the stake. The rope was long enough
to permit him to walk round the stake several times and
then return. Fire was then applied to the hickory poles,
which lay in piles at the distance of six or seven yards
from the stake.</p>
<p>The colonel observing these terrible preparations, called
to Girty, who sat on horseback, at the distance of a few
yards from the fire, and asked if the Indians were going
to burn him. Girty replied in the affirmative. The colonel
heard the intelligence with firmness, merely observing
that he would bear it with fortitude. When the hickory
poles had been burnt asunder in the middle, Captain Pipe
arose and addressed the crowd, in a tone of great energy,
and with animated gestures, pointing frequently to the
colonel, who regarded him with an appearance of unruffled
composure. As soon as he had ended, a loud whoop burst
from the assembled throng, and they all rushed at once
upon the unfortunate Crawford. For several seconds, the
crowd was so great around him, that Knight could not see
what they were doing; but in a short time, they had dispersed
sufficiently to give him a view of the colonel.</p>
<p>His ears had been cut off, and the blood was streaming
down each side of his face. A terrible scene of torture
now commenced. The warriors shot charges of powder
into his naked body, commencing with the calves of his
legs, and continuing to his neck. The boys snatched the
burning hickory poles and applied them to his flesh. As
fast as he ran around the stake, to avoid one party of tormentors,
he was promptly met at every turn by others,
with burning poles, red hot irons, and rifles loaded with
powder only; so that in a few minutes nearly one hundred
charges of powder had been shot into his body, which had
become black and blistered in a dreadful manner. The
squaws would take up a quantity of coals and hot ashes,
and throw them upon his body, so that in a few minutes
he had nothing but fire to walk upon.</p>

CAPTAIN PIPE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In the extremity of his agony, the unhappy colonel called
aloud upon Girty, in tones which rang through Knight&#8217;s
brain with maddening effect: &#8220;Girty! Girty!! shoot me
through the heart!! Quick! quick!! Do not refuse me!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see I have no gun, colonel!!&#8221; replied the renegade,
bursting into a loud laugh, and then turning to an
Indian beside him, he uttered some brutal jests upon the
naked and miserable appearance of the prisoner. While
this awful scene was being acted, Girty rode up to the spot
where Dr. Knight stood, and told him that he had now had
a foretaste of what was in reserve for him at the Shawnee
towns. He swore that he need not expect to escape death,
but should suffer it in all the extremity of torture.</p>
<p>Knight, whose mind was deeply agitated at the sight
of the fearful scene before him, took no notice of Girty,
but preserved an impenetrable silence. Girty, after contemplating
the colonel&#8217;s sufferings for a few moments,
turned again to Knight, and indulged in a bitter invective
against a certain Colonel Gibson, from whom, he said, he
had received deep injury; and dwelt upon the delight with
which he would see him undergo such tortures as those
which Crawford was then suffering. He observed, in a
taunting tone, that most of the prisoners had said, that
the white people would not injure him, if the chance of
war was to throw him into their power; but that for his
own part, he should be loath to try the experiment. &#8220;I
think, (added he with a laugh,) that they would roast me
alive, with more pleasure than those red fellows are now
broiling the colonel! What is your opinion, doctor? Do you
think they would be glad to see me?&#8221; Still Knight made
no answer, and in a few minutes Girty rejoined the Indians.</p>
<p>The terrible scene had now lasted more than two hours,
and Crawford had become much exhausted. He walked
slowly around the stake, spoke in a low tone, and earnestly
besought God to look with compassion upon him, and pardon
his sins. His nerves had lost much of their sensibility, and
he no longer shrunk from the firebrands with which they
incessantly touched him. At length he sunk in a fainting
fit upon his face, and lay motionless. Instantly an Indian
sprung upon his back, knelt lightly upon one knee, made
a circular incision with his knife upon the crown of his
head, and clapping the knife between his teeth, tore the
scalp off with both hands. Scarcely had this been done,
when a withered hag approached with a board full of
burning embers, and poured them upon the crown of his
head, now laid bare to the bone. The colonel groaned
deeply, arose, and again walked slowly around the stake!
But why continue a description so horrible? Nature at
length could endure no more, and at a late hour in the
night, he was released by death from the hands of his
tormentors.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>
<p>Whether Girty really took pleasure in the torture of
Colonel Crawford, or was forced by circumstances to seem
to enjoy it is a question which historians have generally
been in too much haste to determine. It is well known
that at the time of Crawford&#8217;s expedition the Indians
were very much exasperated by the cold-blooded slaughter
of the Moravian red men at Guadenhutten&mdash;an atrocity
without a parallel in border warfare, and to have seemed
merciful to the whites for a single moment would have been
fatal to Girty. Indeed, it is said, that, when he spoke of
ransoming the colonel, Captain Pipe threatened him with
death at the stake. Let justice be rendered even to the
worst of criminals.</p>
<p>Dr. Knight, made bold or desperate by the torture he
had witnessed, effected his escape from the Shawnee warrior
to whose care he was committed, and after much suffering,
reached the settlements. From him the greater
portion of the account of Crawford&#8217;s death is derived, and
corrected by the statements of Indians present on the
occasion. Simon Girty never forsook the Indians among
whom he had made his home; but his influence gradually
diminished. Some accounts say that he perished in the
battle of the Thames; while others assert that he lived
to extreme old age in Canada, where his descendants are
now highly respected citizens.</p>

<h2>Joshua Fleehart.</h2>
</div>

<p>Extraordinary strength and activity, with the most
daring courage and a thorough knowledge of life in the
woods, won for Joshua Fleehart a high reputation among
the first settler&#8217;s of Western Virginia and Ohio. When
the Ohio Company founded its settlement at Marietta, in
April, 1778, Fleehart was employed as a scout and a
hunter. In this service he had no superior north of the
Ohio. At periods of the greatest danger, when the Indians
were known to be much incensed against the whites,
he would start from the settlement with no companion but
his dog, and ranging within about twenty miles of an Indian
town, would build his cabin and trap and hunt during
nearly the whole season. On one occasion this reckless
contempt of danger almost cost the hunter his life.</p>

JOSHUA FLEEHART.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Having became tired of the sameness of garrison life,
and panting for that freedom among the woods and hills
to which he had always been accustomed, late in the fall
of 1795, he took his canoe, rifle, traps, and blanket, with
no one to accompany him, leaving even his faithful dog
in the garrison with his family. As he was going into
a dangerous neighborhood, he was fearful lest the voice
of his dog might betray him. With a daring and intrepidity
which few men possess, he pushed his canoe up the
Sciota river a distance of fifteen or twenty miles, into the
Indian country, amidst their best hunting-grounds for the
bear and the beaver, where no white man had dared to
venture. These two were the main object of his pursuit,
and the hills of Brush creek were said to abound in bear,
and the small streams that fell into the Sciota were well
suited to the haunts of the beaver.</p>
<p>The spot chosen for his winter&#8217;s residence was within
twenty-five or thirty miles of the Indian town of Chillicothe,
but as they seldom go far to hunt in the winter,
he had little to fear from their interruption. For ten or
twelve weeks he trapped and hunted in this solitary region
unmolested; luxuriating on the roasted tails of the
beaver, and drinking the oil of the bear, an article of diet
which is considered by the children of the forest as giving
health to the body, with strength and activity to the limbs.
His success had equalled his most sanguine expectations,
and the winter passed away so quietly and so pleasantly,
that he was hardly aware of its progress. About the
middle of February, he began to make up the peltry he
had captured into packages, and to load his canoe with
the proceeds of his winter&#8217;s hunt, which for safety had
been secreted in the willows, a few miles below the little
bark hut in which he had lived. The day before that
which he had fixed on for his departure, as he was returning
to his camp, just at evening, Fleehart&#8217;s acute ear caught
the report of a rifle in the direction of the Indian towns,
but at so remote a distance, that none but a backwoodsman
could have distinguished the sound. This hastened
his preparations for decamping. Nevertheless he slept
quietly, but rose the following morning before the dawn;
cooked and ate his last meal in the little hut to which he
had become quite attached.</p>

FLEEHART SHOOTING THE INDIAN.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The sun had just risen, while he was sitting on the trunk
of a fallen tree, examining the priming and lock of his gun,
casually casting a look up the river bank, he saw an Indian
slowly approaching with his eyes intently fixed on the
ground, carefully inspecting the track of his moccasins,
left in the soft earth as he returned to his hut the evening
before. He instantly cocked his gun, stepped behind a
tree, and waited till the Indian came within the sure range
of his shot. He then fired and the Indian fell. Rushing
from the cover on his prostrate foe, he was about to apply
the scalping knife; but seeing the shining silver broaches,
and broad bands on his arms, he fell to cutting them loose,
and tucking them into the bosom of his hunting shirt.
While busily occupied in securing the spoils, the sharp
crack of a rifle and the passage of the ball through the
bullet pouch at his side, caused him to look up, when he
saw three Indians within a hundred yards of him. They
being too numerous for him to encounter, he seized his
rifle and took to flight. The other two, as he ran, fired
at him without effect. The chase was continued for several
miles by two of the Indians, who were the swiftest
runners. He often stopped and &#8220;treed,&#8221; hoping to get a
shot and kill or disable one of them, and then overcome
the other at his leisure. His pursuers also &#8220;treed,&#8221; and
by flanking to the right and left, forced him to uncover
or stand the chance of a shot.</p>
<p>He finally concluded to leave the level grounds, on
which the contest had thus far been held, and take to the
high hills which lie back of the bottoms. His strong,
muscular limbs here gave him the advantage, as he could
ascend the steep hill sides more rapidly than his pursuers.
The Indians, seeing they could not overtake him, as a last
effort stopped and fired. One of the balls cut away the
handle of his hunting-knife, jerking it so violently against
his side, that for a moment he thought he was wounded.
He immediately returned the fire, and, with a yell of
vexation, they gave up the chase.</p>
<p>Fleehart made a circuit among the hills, and just at
dark came in to the river, near where the canoe lay hid.
Springing lightly on board, he paddled down stream.
Being greatly fatigued with the efforts of the day, he lay
down in the canoe, and when he awoke in the morning
the boat was just entering the Ohio river. Crossing over
to the southern shore, he, in a few days, pushed his canoe
up to Farmer&#8217;s Castle, without further adventure, where
he showed the rich packages of peltry, as the proceeds
of his winter&#8217;s hunt, and displayed the brilliant silver
ornaments, as trophies of his victory, to the envy and
admiration of his less venturous companions.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<h2>Indian Fight on the Little Muskingum.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the latter part of September, 1789, an alarm being
given that Indians had been seen in the Campus Martius,
on the Ohio, a party consisting of five or six rangers, ten
volunteer citizens, and twelve regular soldiers was collected
for pursuit.</p>
<p>The men went up in canoes to the mouth of Duck creek,
where they left their water craft. The more experienced
rangers soon fell upon the trail, which they traced across
the wide bottoms on to the Little Muskingum. At a point
about half a mile below where Conner&#8217;s mill now stands,
the Indians forded the creek. In a hollow, between the
hills, about a mile east of the creek, they discovered the
smoke of their camp fire. The rangers now divided the
volunteers into two flanking parties, with one of the spies
at the head of each, and three of their number to act in
front. By the time the flankers had come in range of the
camp, the Indians discovered their pursuers, by the noise
of the soldiers who lagged behind, and were not so cautious
in their movement. They instantly fled up the run on
which they were encamped. Two of their number leaving
the main body, ascended the point of a hill, with a ravine
on the right and left of it.</p>

AN INDIAN BRAVE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The rangers now began to fire, while the Indians, each
one taking his tree, returned the shot. One of the two Indians
on the spur of the ridge was wounded through the
hips, by one of the spies on the right, who pushed on manfully
to gain the flanks of the enemy. The men in front
came on more slowly, and as they began to ascend the
point of the ridge, Ned Henderson, who was posted on high
ground, cried out &#8220;Kerr! Kerr! there is an Indian behind
that white oak, and he will kill some of you.&#8221; Kerr
instantly sprung behind a large tree, and Peter Anderson,
who was near him, behind a hickory, too small to cover
more than half his body, while John Wiser jumped down
into the ravine. At that instant the Indian fired at Anderson,
and as John looked over the edge of the bank to
learn the effect of the shot, he saw Peter wiping the dust
of the hickory bark out of his eyes. The ball grazed the
tree, just opposite his nose, and glancing off did him no
serious harm, but filling his eyes with the dust, and cutting
his nose with the splinters. At the same time Henderson,
with others, fired at the Indian, and he fell with several
balls through his body. The brave fellow who was killed
lost his life in a noble effort to aid his friend, who had been
wounded through the hips, and could not spring up on to
the little bench, or break in the ridge, where he was
standing.</p>
<p>While occupied in this labor of love, the rangers on his
flanks had so far advanced, that the shelter of the friendly
tree could no longer secure him from their shots, as it had
done while his enemies were more in front of him. The
wounded Indian escaped for the present, although it is
probable he died soon after. The other five Indians, there
being seven in the party, seeing that their enemies outnumbered
them so greatly, after firing a few times, made
a circuit to the right and came up in the rear of the soldiers,
who were occupying themselves with the contents
of the kettle of hog meat and potatoes, which the Indians
in their hurry had left boiling over the fire. The first notice
they had of their danger was the report of their rifles. It
made a huge uproar among the musketeers, who taking
to flight, ran in great alarm for protection to the rangers.
As it happened the Indians were too far off to do much
harm, and no one was injured but one poor fellow, who was
shot through the seat of his trowsers, just grazing the
skin. He tumbled into the brook by the side of the camp,
screaming at the top of his voice, &#8220;I am kill&#8217;d, I am kill&#8217;d,&#8221;
greatly to the amusement of the rangers, who were soon
at his side, and dragging him out of the water, searched
in vain for the mortal wound. The dead Indian was
scalped, and his rifle and blanket taken as the legitimate
plunder of a conquered foe. The other five retreated out
of reach of the rangers, after their feat of frightening the
soldiers. They returned to the garrison, well pleased
that none of their men were killed, but much vexed with
the soldiers, whose indiscretion had prevented their destroying
the whole of the Indians, had they encircled them
as first arranged by the leaders of the party. It served
as a warning to the Indians not to approach too near the
Yankee garrison, as their rangers were brave men, whose
eyes and ears were always open.<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<a name='ESCAPE_OF_RETURN_J_MEIGS' id='ESCAPE_OF_RETURN_J_MEIGS'></a>
<h2>Escape of Return J. Meigs.</h2>
</div>

<p>During the continuance of the Indian wars, from 1790
to 1795, it was customary for the inmates of all the garrisons
to cultivate considerable fields of Indian corn and
other vegetables near the walls of their defences. Although
hazardous in the extreme, it was preferable to
starvation. For a part of that time no provisions could be
obtained from the older settlements above, on the Monongahela
and Ohio; sometimes from a scarcity amongst
themselves, and always at great hazard from Indians,
who watched the river for the capture of boats. Another
reason was the want of money; many of the settlers having
expended a large share of their funds in the journey
on, and for the purchase of lands, while others had not a
single dollar; so that necessity compelled them to plant
their fields. The war having commenced so soon after
their arrival, and at a time when not expected, as a formal
treaty was made with them at Marietta, in January,
1789, which by the way was only a piece of Indian diplomacy,
they never intended to abide by it longer than
suited their convenience, and no stores being laid up for
a siege, they were taken entirely unprepared. So desperate
were their circumstances at one period, that serious
thoughts of abandoning the country were entertained by
many of the leading men. Under these circumstances
R. J. Meigs, then a young lawyer, was forced to lay
aside the gown, and assume the use of both the sword and
plough. It is true that but little ploughing was done, as
much of the corn was then raised by planting the virgin
soil with a hoe, amongst the stumps and logs of the clearing,
after burning off the brush and light stuff. In this
way large crops were invariably produced; so that nearly
all the implements needed were the axe and the hoe. It
so happened that Mr. Meigs, whose residence was in
Campus Martius, the garrison on the east side of the
Muskingum river, had planted a field of corn on the west
side of that stream in the vicinity of Fort Harmar. To
reach this field the river was to be crossed near his residence
in a canoe, and the space between the landing and
his crop, a distance of about half a mile, to be passed by
an obscure path through a thick wood.</p>

AN INDIAN WARRIOR.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Early in June, 1792, Mr. Meigs, having completed the
labor of the day a little before night, set out on his return
home in company with Joseph Symonds and a colored boy,
which he had brought with him as a servant from Connecticut.
Immediately on leaving the field they entered
the forest through which they had to pass before reaching
the canoe. Symonds and the boy were unarmed; Mr.
Meigs carried a small shot-gun, which he had taken with
him for the purpose of shooting a turkey, which at that
day abounded to an extent that would hardly be credited
at this time. Flocks of several hundred were not uncommon,
and of a size and fatness that would excite the admiration
of an epicure of any period of the world, even
of Apicius himself. Meeting, however, with no turkies,
he had discharged his gun at a large snake which crossed
his path. They had now arrived within a few rods of
the landing, when two Indians, who had been for some
time watching their movements and heard the discharge
of the gun, sprang into the path behind them, fired and
shot Symonds through the shoulder. He being an excellent
swimmer, rushed down the bank and into the Muskingum
river; where, turning on his back, he was enabled to
support himself on the surface until he floated down near
Fort Harmar, where he was taken up by a canoe. His
wound, although a dangerous one, was healed, and he was
alive twenty years afterwards. The black boy followed
Symonds into the river as far as he could wade, but being
no swimmer, was unable to get out of reach of the Indian
who pursued them, and was seized and dragged on shore.
The Indian who had captured him was desirous of making
him a prisoner, which he so obstinately refused, and made
so much resistance that he finally tomahawked and scalped
him near the edge of the water. To this alternative he
was in a manner compelled, rather than lose both prisoner
and scalp, as the rangers and men at Campus Martius
had commenced firing at him from the opposite shore. The
first shot was fired by a spirited black man in the service
of Commodore Abraham Whipple, who was employed near
the river at the time.</p>
<p>From some accident, it appears that only one of the
Indians was armed with a rifle, while the other had a tomahawk
and knife. After Symonds was shot, Mr. Meigs
immediately faced about in order to retreat to Fort Harmar.
The savage armed with the rifle, had placed himself in the
path, intending to cut off his escape, but had no time to
reload before his intended victim clubbed his gun and
rushed upon his antagonist. As he passed, Mr. Meigs
aimed a blow at his head, which the Indian returned with
his rifle. From the rapidity of the movement, neither of
them were seriously injured, although it staggered both
considerably, yet neither fell to the ground. Instantly
recovering from the shock, he pursued his course to the
fort with the Indian close at his heels. Mr. Meigs was in
the vigor of early manhood, and had, by frequent practice
in the race, become a very swift runner. His foeman was
also very fleet, and amongst the most active of their warriors,
as none but such were sent into the settlements on
marauding excursions. The race continued for sixty or
eighty rods with little advantage on either side, when Mr.
Meigs gradually increased his distance ahead, and leaping
across a deep run that traversed the path, the Indian
stopped on the brink, threw his tomahawk, and gave up
the pursuit with one of those fierce yells which rage and
disappointment both served to sharpen. It was distinctly
heard at both the forts. About sixteen years since, an
Indian tomahawk was ploughed up near this spot, and
was most probably the one thrown at Mr. Meigs; as the
rescue and pursuit from Fort Harmar was so immediate
upon hearing the alarm, that he had no time to recover
it. With the scalp of the poor black boy, the Indians
ascended the abrupt side of the hill which overlooked the
garrison, and shouting defiance to their foes, escaped in
the forest.</p>
<p>The excitement was very great at the garrison, and
taught the inmates a useful lesson; that of being better
armed and more on their guard when they went out on
agricultural pursuits. Had Mr. Meigs tried any other
expedient than that of facing his enemy and rushing instantly
upon him, he must have lost his life, as the Indian
was well aware of his gun being unloaded. On his
right was the river, on his left a very high hill; beyond
him the pathless forest, and between him and the fort his
Indian foe. To his sudden and unexpected attack, to his
dauntless and intrepid manner, and to his activity, he
undoubtedly owed his life.</p>

<a name='ESTILL_S_DEFEAT' id='ESTILL_S_DEFEAT'></a>
<h2>Estill&#8217;s Defeat.</h2>
</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable pioneer fights, in the
early history of the west, was that waged by Captain
James Estill, and seventeen of his associates, on the 22d
of March, 1782, with a party of Wyandotte Indians,
twenty-five in number. Seventy-one years almost have
elapsed since; yet one of the actors in that sanguinary
struggle, Rev. Joseph Proctor, of Estill county, Kentucky,
survived to the 2d of December, 1844, dying in the full
enjoyment of his faculties at the age of ninety. His wife,
the partner of his early privations and toils, and nearly
as old as himself, deceased six months previously.</p>
<p>On the 19th of March 1782, Indian rafts, without any
one on them, were seen floating down the Kentucky river,
past Boonesborough. Intelligence of this fact was immediately
dispatched by Colonel Logan to Captain Estill,
at his station fifteen miles from Boonesborough, and near
the present site of Richmond, Kentucky, together with a
force of fifteen men, who were directed to march from
Lincoln county to Estill&#8217;s assistance, instructing Captain
Estill, if the Indians had not appeared there, to scour the
country with a reconnoitring party, as it could not be
known at what point the attack would be made.</p>

SLAUGHTER OF MISS INNES.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Estill lost not a moment in collecting a force to go in
search of the savages, not doubting, from his knowledge
of the Indian character, that they designed an immediate
blow at his or some of the neighboring stations. From
his own and the nearest stations, he raised twenty-five
men. Whilst Estill and his men were on this excursion,
the Indians suddenly appeared around his station at the
dawn of day, on the 20th of March, killed and scalped
Miss Innes, and took Munk, a slave of Captain Estill,
captive. The Indians immediately and hastily retreated,
in consequence of a highly exaggerated account which
Munk gave them of the strength of the station, and
number of fighting men in it. No sooner had the
Indians commenced their retreat, than the women in the
fort (the men being all absent except one on the sick list,)
dispatched two boys, the late General Samuel South and
Peter Hacket, to take the trail of Captain Estill and his
men, and, overtaking them, give information of what had
occurred at the fort. The boys succeeded in coming up
with Captain Estill early on the morning of the 21st, between
the mouths of Drowning creek and Red river.
After a short search, Captain Estill&#8217;s party struck the
trail of the retreating Indians. It was resolved at once
to make pursuit, and no time was lost in doing so. Five
men of the party, however, who had families in the fort,
feeling uneasy for their safety, and unwilling to trust
their defence to the few who remained there, returned to
the fort, leaving Captain Estill&#8217;s party thirty-five in
number. These pressed the pursuit of the retreating Indians,
as rapidly as possible, but night coming on they
encamped near the Little Mountain, at present the site
of Mount Sterling.</p>

CAPTAIN ESTILL.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Early next morning they put forward, being obliged to
leave ten of the men behind, whose horses were too jaded
to travel further. They had not proceeded far until they
discovered by fresh tracks of the Indians, that they were
not far distant. They then marched in four lines until
about an hour before sunset, when they discovered six of
the savages helping themselves to rations from the body
of a buffalo which they had killed. The company was
ordered to dismount. With the usual impetuosity of
Kentuckians, some of the party fired without regarding
orders, and the Indians fled. One of the party, a Mr.
David Cook, who acted as ensign, exceedingly ardent and
active, had proceeded in advance of the company, and
seeing an Indian halt, raised his gun and fired. At the
same moment another Indian crossed on the opposite
side, and they were both leveled with the same shot. This
occurring in view of the whole company, inspired them
all with a high degree of confidence. In the meantime,
the main body of Indians had heard the alarm and returned,
and the two hostile parties exactly matched in
point of numbers, having twenty-five on each side, and
were now face to face. The ground was highly favorable
to the Indian mode of warfare; but Captain Estill and
his men, without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, boldly and fearlessly
commenced an attack upon them, and the latter as
boldly and fearlessly (for they were picked warriors) engaged
in the bloody combat. It is, however, disgraceful
to relate, that, at the very onset of the action, Lieutenant
Miller, of Captain Estill&#8217;s party, with six men under his
command, &#8220;ingloriously fled&#8221; from the field, thereby
placing in jeopardy the whole of their comrades, and
causing the death of many brave soldiers. Hence, Estill&#8217;s
party numbered eighteen, and the Wyandottes twenty-five.</p>
<p>The flank becoming thus unprotected, Captain Estill
directed Cook with three men to occupy Miller&#8217;s station,
and repel the attack in that quarter to which this base act
of cowardice exposed the whole party. The ensign with
his party were taking the position assigned, when one of
them discovered an Indian and shot him, and the three
retreated to a little eminence whence they thought greater
execution could be effected with less danger to themselves,
but Cook continued to advance without noticing the absence
of his party until he had discharged his gun with effect,
when he immediately retreated, but after running some
distance to a large tree, for the purpose of shelter in firing,
he unfortunately got entangled in the tops of fallen timber,
and halting for a moment, received a ball which struck him
just below the shoulder blade, and came out below his collar
bone. In the meantime, on the main field of battle, at the
distance of fifty yards, the fight raged with great fury,
lasting one hour and three-quarters. On either side
wounds and death were inflicted, neither party advancing
or retreating. &#8220;Every man to his man, and every man
to his tree.&#8221; Captain Estill at this period was covered
with blood from a wound received early in the action; nine
of his brave companions lay dead upon the field; and
four others were so disabled by their wounds, as to be
unable to continue the fight. Captain Estill&#8217;s fighting
men were now reduced to four. Among this number was
Joseph Proctor.</p>
<p>Captain Estill, the brave leader of this Spartan band,
was now brought into a personal conflict with a powerful
and active Wyandotte warrior. The conflict was for a
time fierce and desperate, and keenly and anxiously watched
by Proctor, with his finger on the trigger of his unerring
rifle. Such, however, was the struggle between these fierce
and powerful warriors, that Proctor could not shoot without
greatly endangering the safety of his captain. Estill had
had his arm broken the preceding summer in an engagement
with the Indians; and, in the conflict with the warrior
on this occasion, that arm gave way, and in an instant
his savage foe buried his knife in Captain Estill&#8217;s breast;
but in the very same moment, the brave Proctor sent a ball
from his rifle to the Wyandotte&#8217;s heart. The survivors then
drew off as by mutual consent.&mdash;Thus ended this memorable
battle. It wanted nothing but the circumstance of
numbers to make it the most memorable in ancient or modern
times. The loss of the Indians, in killed and wounded,
notwithstanding the disparity of numbers after the shameful
retreat of Miller, was even greater than that of Captain
Estill.</p>
<p>It was afterwards ascertained by prisoners who were
recaptured from the Wyandotte, that seventeen of the Indians
had been killed, and two severely wounded. This
battle was fought on the same day, with the disastrous
battle of the Blue Licks, March 22d, 1782.</p>
<p>There is a tradition derived from the Wyandotte towns,
after the peace, that but one of the warriors engaged in
this battle ever returned to his nation. It is certain that
the chief who led on the Wyandottes with so much desperation,
fell in the action. Throughout this bloody engagement
the coolness and bravery of Proctor were unsurpassed.
But his conduct after the battle has always, with those
acquainted with it, elicited the warmest commendation. He
brought off the field of battle, and most of the way to the
station, a distance of forty miles, on his back, his badly
wounded friend, the late brave Colonel William Irvine, so
long and so favorably known in Kentucky.</p>

<h2>A Pioneer Mother.</h2>
</div>

<p>The mothers of the west deserve as wide a fame as
their fearless husbands and brothers. In no situation
were courage and resolution so much required in women
as in the western wilderness, during the Indian wars,
and even the celebrated heroines of European history
seem to us ordinary in comparison.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1779, Samuel Daviess, who resided in
Bedford county, Virginia, moved with his family to Kentucky,
and lived for a time, at Whitley&#8217;s station, in
Lincoln. After residing for some time in the station, he removed
for a time to a place called Gilmer&#8217;s Lick, some
six or seven miles distant from said station, where he built
a cabin, cleared some land, which he put in corn next
season, not apprehending any danger from the Indians,
although he was considered a frontier settler. But this
imaginary state of security did not last long; for one
morning in August, 1782, having stepped a few paces
from his door, he was suddenly surprised by an Indian
appearing between him and the door, with tomahawk uplifted,
almost within striking distance. In this unexpected
condition, and being entirely unarmed, his first thought
was, that by running round the house, he could enter the
door in safety, but to his surprise, in attempting to effect
this object, as he approached the door he found the house
full of Indians. Being closely pursued by the Indian first
mentioned, he made his way into the cornfield, where he
concealed himself with much difficulty, until the pursuing
Indian had returned to the house.</p>

SCALPING.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Unable as he was to render any relief to his family,
there being five Indians, he ran with the utmost speed to
the station of his brother, a distance of five miles. As
he approached the station, his undressed condition told
the tale of his distresses, before he was able to tell it himself.
Almost breathless, and with a faltering voice, he
could only say, his wife and children were in the hands
of the Indians. Scarcely was the communication made
when he obtained a spare gun, and the five men in the
station, well armed, followed him to his residence. When
they arrived at the house, the Indians, as well as the family
were found to be gone, and no evidence appeared
that any of the family had been killed. A search was
made to find the direction the Indians had taken; but owing
to the dryness of the ground, and the adroit manner in
which they had departed, no discovery could be made.
In this study and perplexity, the party being all good
woodsmen, took that direction in pursuit of the Indians,
which they thought it most probable they would take.
After going a few miles, their attention was arrested by
the howling of a dog, which afterwards turned out to be
a house-dog that had followed the family, and which the
Indians had undertaken to kill, so as to avoid detection,
which might happen from his occasionally barking. In
attempting to kill the dog, he was only wounded, which
produced the howling that was heard. The noise thus
heard, satisfied them that they were near the Indians, and
enabled them to rush forward with the utmost impetuosity.
Two of the Indians being in the rear as spies, discovering
the approach of the party, ran forward to where the Indians
were with the family&mdash;one of them knocked down
the oldest boy, about eleven years old, and while in the
act of scalping him, was fired at, but without effect. Mrs.
Daviess, seeing the agitation and alarm of the Indians,
saved herself and sucking child, by jumping into a sink
hole. The Indians did not stand to make fight, but fled
in the most precipitate manner. In that way the family
was rescued by nine o&#8217;clock in the morning, without the
loss of a single life, and without any injury but that above
mentioned. So soon as the boy had risen on his feet, the
first words he spoke were, &#8220;Curse that Indian, he has got
my scalp!&#8221; After the family had been rescued, Mrs.
Daviess gave the following account of how the Indians
had acted.</p>

GOING INTO CAPTIVITY.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A few minutes after her husband had opened the door
and stepped out of the house, four Indians rushed in,
whilst the fifth, as she afterwards learned, was in pursuit
of her husband. Herself and children were in bed when
the Indians entered the house. One of the Indians immediately
made signs, by which she understood him to inquire
how far it was to the next house. With an unusual presence
of mind, knowing how important it would be to make the
distance as far as possible, she raised both her hands, first
counting the fingers of one hand, then of the other&mdash;making
a distance of eight miles. The Indian then signed to her
that she must rise; she immediately got up, and as soon
as she could dress herself, commenced showing the Indians
one article of clothing after another, which pleased them
very much; and in that way, delayed them at the house
nearly two hours. In the meantime, the Indian who had
been in pursuit of her husband, returned with his hands
stained with poke berries, which he held up, and with some
violent gestures, and waving of his tomahawk, attempted
to induce the belief, that the stain on his hands was the
blood of her husband, and that he had killed him. She
was enabled at once to discover the deception, and instead
of producing any alarm on her part, she was satisfied that
her husband had escaped uninjured.</p>
<p>After the savages had plundered the house of everything
that they could conveniently carry off with them, they
started, taking Mrs. Daviess and her children&mdash;seven in
number, as prisoners along with them. Some of the children
were too young to travel as fast as the Indians wished,
and discovering, as she believed, their intention to kill
such of them as could not conveniently travel, she made
the two oldest boys carry them on their backs. The Indians,
in starting from the house, were very careful to leave
no signs of the direction which they had taken, not even
permitting the children to break a twig or weed, as they
passed along. They had not gone far, before an Indian
drew a knife and cut off a few inches of Mrs. Daviess&#8217; dress,
so that she would not be interrupted in travelling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Daviess was a woman of cool, deliberate courage,
and accustomed to handle the gun so that she could shoot
well, as many of the women were in the habit of doing in
those days. She had contemplated, as a last resort, that
if not rescued in the course of the day, when night came
and the Indians had fallen asleep, she would rescue herself
and children by killing as many of the Indians as she
could&mdash;thinking that in a night attack as many of them
as remained, would most probably run off. Such an attempt
would now seem a species of madness; but to those
who were acquainted with Mrs. Daviess, little doubt was
entertained, that if the attempt had been made, it would
have proved successful.</p>
<p>The boy who had been scalped, was greatly disfigured,
as the hair never after grew upon that part of the head.
He often wished for an opportunity to avenge himself upon
the Indians for the injury he had received. Unfortunately
for himself, ten years afterwards, the Indians came to the
neighborhood of his father and stole a number of horses.</p>
<p>Himself and a party of men went in pursuit of them, and
after following them for some days, the Indians finding
that they were likely to be overtaken, placed themselves
in ambush, and when their pursuers came up, killed young
Daviess and one other man; so that he ultimately fell into
their hands when about twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>The next year after the father died; his death being
caused, as it was supposed, by the extraordinary efforts he
made to release his family from the Indians.</p>
<p>We cannot close this account, without noticing an act
of courage displayed by Mrs. Daviess, calculated to exhibit
her character in its true point of view.</p>
<p>Kentucky, in its early days, like most new countries,
was occasionally troubled with men of abandoned character,
who lived by stealing the property of others, and after
committing their depredations, retired to their hiding
places, thereby eluding the operation of the law. One of
these marauders, a man of desperate character, who had
committed extensive thefts from Mr. Daviess, as well as
from his neighbors, was pursued by Daviess and a party
whose property he had taken, in order to bring him to
justice. While the party were in pursuit, the suspected
individual, not knowing any one was pursuing him, came
to the house of Daviess, armed with his gun and tomahawk&mdash;no
person being at home but Mrs. Daviess and her children.
After he had stepped in the house, Mrs. Daviess
asked him if he would drink something&mdash;and having set a
bottle of whiskey upon the table, requested him to help
himself. The fellow not suspecting any danger, set his
gun up by the door, and while drinking, Mrs. Daviess
picked up his gun, and placing herself in the door, had the
gun cocked and levelled upon him by the time he turned
around, and in a peremptory manner, ordered him to take
a seat, or she would shoot him. Struck with terror and
alarm, he asked what he had done. She told him, he had
stolen her husband&#8217;s property, and that she intended to
take care of him herself. In that condition, she held him
a prisoner, until the party of men returned and took him
into their possession.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
<h2>The Squatter&#8217;s Wife and Daughter.</h2>
</div>

<p>On the Illinois river, near two hundred miles from its
junction with the Mississippi, there lived in 1812, an old
pioneer, known in those days as &#8220;Old Parker the squatter.&#8221;
His family consisted of a wife and three children, the oldest
a boy of nineteen, a girl of seventeen, and the youngest a
boy of fourteen. At the time of which we write, Parker
and his oldest boy had gone in company with three Indians
on a hunt, expecting to be absent some five or six days.&mdash;The
third day after the departure, one of the Indians returned
to Parker&#8217;s house, came in and sat himself down
by the fire, lit his pipe and commenced smoking in silence.
Mrs. Parker thought nothing of this, as it was no uncommon
thing for one or sometimes more of a party of Indians to
return abruptly from a hunt, at some sign they might consider
ominous of bad luck, and in such instances were not
very communicative. But at last the Indian broke silence
with &#8220;ugh, old Parker die.&#8221; This exclamation immediately
drew Mrs. Parker&#8217;s attention, who directly enquired
of the Indian, what&#8217;s the matter with Parker? The Indian
responded Parker sick, tree fell on him, you go, he
die. Mrs. Parker then asked the Indian if Parker had
sent for her, and where he was? The replies of the Indian
somewhat aroused her suspicions. She, however, came to
the conclusion to send her son with the Indian to see what
was the matter. The boy and Indian started. That night
passed, and the next day too, and neither the boy or Indian
returned. This confirmed Mrs. Parker in her opinion
that there was foul play on the part of the Indians. So
she and her daughter went to work and barricaded the
door and windows in the best way they could. The youngest
boy&#8217;s rifle was the only one left, he not having taken it
with him when he went to hunt after his father. The old
lady took the rifle, the daughter the axe, and thus armed
they determined to watch through the night; and defend
themselves if necessary. They had not long to wait after
night fall, for shortly after that some one commenced
knocking at the door, crying out &#8220;Mother! mother!&#8221; but
Mrs. Parker thought the voice was not exactly like that of
her son&mdash;in order to ascertain the fact, she said &#8220;Jake,
where are the Indians?&#8221; The reply which was &#8220;um gone,&#8221;
satisfied her on that point. She then said, as if speaking
to her son, &#8220;Put your ear to the latch-hole of the door I
want to tell you something before I open the door.&#8221; The
head was placed at the latch-hole, and the old lady fired
through the same spot and killed an Indian. She stepped
back from the door instantly, and it was well she did so,
for quicker than I have penned the last two words two rifle
bullets came crashing through the door. The old lady
then said to her daughter, &#8220;Thank God there are but two, I
must have killed the one at the door&mdash;they must be the
three who went on the hunt with your father. If we can
only kill or cripple another of them, we will be safe; now
we must both be still after they fire again, and they will
then break the door down, and I may be able to shoot
another one; but if I miss them when getting in, you must
use the axe.&#8221;&mdash;The daughter equally courageous with her
mother assured her she would. Soon after this conversation
two more rifle bullets came crashing through the
window. A death-like stillness ensued for about five minutes,
when two more balls in quick succession were fired
through the door, then followed a tremendous punching
with a log, the door gave way, and with a fiendish yell an
Indian was about to spring in, when the unerring rifle fired
by the old lady stretched his lifeless body across the thresh-hold
of the door. The remaining, or more properly the
surviving Indian fired at random and ran, doing no injury.
&#8220;Now&#8221; said the old heroine to her undaunted daughter
&#8220;we must leave.&#8221; Accordingly with the rifle and the axe,
they went to the river, took the canoe, and without a
mouthful of provision except one wild duck and two black
birds which the mother shot, and which were eaten raw,
did these two courageous hearts in six days arrive among
the old French settlers at St. Louis. A party of about a
dozen men crossed over into Illinois&mdash;and after an unsuccessful
search returned without finding either Parker or his
boys. They were never found. There are yet some of
the old settlers in the neighborhood of Peoria who still
point out the spot where &#8220;old Parker the squatter&#8221; lived.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
<h2>Captain William Hubbell.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the year 1791, when the Indians were very troublesome
on the banks of the Ohio, Captain William Hubbell,
Mr. Daniel Light, Mr. William Plascut, Mrs. Plascut and
eight children embarked in a flat-bottomed boat to proceed
down the Ohio.</p>
<p>On their progress down the river, and soon after passing
Pittsburgh, they saw evident traces of Indians along the
banks, and there is every reason to believe that a boat
which they overtook, and which, through carelessness, was
suffered to run aground on an island, became a prey to
these merciless savages. Though Captain Hubbell and
his party stopped some time for it in a lower part of the
river, it did not arrive, and has never to their knowledge
been heard of since. Before they reached the mouth of
the Great Kenhawa, they had by several successive additions,
increased their number to twenty, consisting of nine
men, three women, and eight children. The men, besides
those mentioned above, were one John Stoner, an Irishman
and a Dutchman, whose names are not recollected, Messrs.
Ray and Tucker, and a Mr. Kilpatrick, whose two daughters
also were of the party. Information received at Galliopolis
confirmed the expectation, which appearance previously
raised, of a serious conflict with a large body of Indians;
and as Captain Hubbell had been regularly appointed commander
of the boat, every possible preparation was made
for a formidable and successful resistance of the anticipated
attack. The nine men were divided into three watches
for the night, which were alternately to continue awake,
and be on the look out for two hours at a time. The arms
on board, which consisted principally of old muskets, much
out of order, were collected, loaded, and put in the best
possible condition for service. About sunset on that day,
the 23d of March, 1792, the party overtook a fleet of six
boats descending the river in company, and intended to
continue with them, but as their passengers seemed to be
more disposed to dancing than fighting, and as soon after
dark, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Captain Hubbell,
they commenced fiddling and dancing instead of preparing
their arms, and taking the necessary rest preparatory
to battle, it was wisely considered more hazardous to
be in such company, than to be alone. It was therefore
determined to proceed rapidly forward by the aid of the
oars, and leave those thoughtless fellow-travellers behind.
One of the boats, however, belonging to the fleet, commanded
by a Captain Greathouse, adopted the same plan, and for
a while kept up with Captain Hubbell, but all its crew at
length falling asleep, that boat also ceased to be propelled
by the oars, and Captain Hubbell and his party proceeded
steadily forward alone. Early in the night a canoe was
dimly seen floating down the river, in which were probably
Indians reconnoitering, and other evident indications were
observed of the neighborhood and hostile intentions of a
formidable party of savages.</p>
<p>It was now agreed, that should the attack, as was probable,
be deferred till morning, every man should be up
before the dawn, in order to make as great a show as possible
of numbers and of strength; and that, whenever the
action should take place, the women and children should
lie down on the cabin floor, and be protected as well as
they could by the trunks and other baggage, which might
be placed around them. In this perilous situation they
continued during the night, and the captain, who had not
slept more than one hour since he left Pittsburgh, was too
deeply impressed with the imminent danger which surrounded
him to obtain any rest at that time.</p>

A SIOUX CHIEF.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Just as daylight began to appear in the east, and before
the men were up and at their posts, agreeably to arrangement,
a voice at some distance below them, in a plaintive
tone, repeatedly solicited them to come on shore, as there
were some white persons who wished to obtain a passage
in their boat. This the captain very naturally and correctly
concluded to be an Indian artifice, and its only effect
was to rouse the men, and place every one on his guard.
The voice of entreaty was soon changed into the language
of indignation and insult, and the sound of distant paddles
announced the approach of the savage foe. At length
three Indian canoes were seen through the mist of the
morning rapidly advancing. With the utmost coolness
the captain and his companions prepared to receive them.
The chairs, tables, and other incumbrances were thrown
into the river, in order to clear the deck for action. Every
man took his position, and was ordered not to fire till the
savages had approached so near, that, (to use the words
of Captain Hubbell,) &#8220;the flash from the guns might singe
their eye-brows;&#8221; and a special caution was given, that
the men should fire successively, so that there might be no
interval. On the arrival of the canoes, they were found to
contain about twenty-five or thirty Indians each. As soon
as they had approached within the reach of musket-shot,
a general fire was given from one of them, which wounded
Mr. Tucker through the hip so severely that his leg hung
only by the flesh, and shot Mr. Light just below his ribs.
The three canoes placed themselves at the bow, stern, and
on the right side of the boat, so that they had an opportunity
of raking in every direction. The fire now commenced
from the boat, and had a powerful effect in checking
the confidence and fury of the Indians. The captain
after firing his own gun, took up that of one of the wounded
men, raised it to his shoulder, and was about to discharge
it, when a ball came and took away the lock; he coolly
turned round, seized a brand of fire from the kettle which
served for a caboose, and applying it to the pan, discharged
the piece with effect. A very regular and constant fire
was now kept up on both sides. The captain was just in
the act of raising his gun a third time, when a ball passed
through his right arm, and for a moment disabled him.
Scarcely had he recovered from the shock, and re-acquired
the use of his hand, which had been suddenly drawn up
by the wound, when he observed the Indians in one of the
canoes just about to board the boat in its bow, where the
horses were placed belonging to the party. So near had
they approached, that some of them had actually seized
with their hands the side of the boat. Severely wounded
as he was, he caught up a pair of horsemen&#8217;s pistols and
rushed forward to repel the attempt at boarding. On his
approach the Indians fell back, and he discharged a pistol
with effect at the foremost man. After firing the second
pistol, he found himself without arms, and was compelled
to retreat; but stepping back on a pile of small wood which
had been prepared for burning in the kettle, the thought
struck him, that it might be made use of in repelling the
foe, and he continued for some time to strike them with it
so forcibly and actively, that they were unable to enter
the boat, and at length he wounded one of them so severely
that with a yell they suddenly gave way. All the canoes
then discontinued the contest, and directed their course to
Captain Greathouse&#8217;s boat, which was in sight. Here a
striking contrast was exhibited to the firmness and intrepidity
which had been displayed. Instead of resisting the
attack, the people on board of this boat retired to the cabin
in dismay. The Indians entered it without opposition, and
rowed it to the shore, where they killed the captain and
a lad of about fourteen years of age. The women they
placed in the centre of their canoes, and manning them
with fresh hands, again pursued Captain Hubbell and party.
A melancholy alternative now presented itself to these
brave but almost desponding men, either to fall a prey to
the savages themselves, or to run the risk of shooting the
women, who had been placed in the canoes in the hope of
deriving protection from their presence. But &#8220;self preservation
is the first law of nature,&#8221; and the captain very
justly remarked, there would not be much humanity in
preserving their lives at such a sacrifice, merely that they
might become victims of savage cruelty at some subsequent
period.</p>
<p>There were now but four men left on board of Captain
Hubbell&#8217;s boat, capable of defending it, and the captain
himself was severely wounded in two places. The second
attack, however, was resisted with almost incredible firmness
and vigor. Whenever the Indians would rise to fire,
their opponents would frequently give them the first shot,
which in almost every instance would prove fatal. Notwithstanding
the disparity of numbers, and the exhausted
condition of the defenders of the boat, the Indians at
length appeared to despair of success, and the canoes successively
retired to the shore. Just as the last one was
departing, Captain Hubbell called to the Indian, who was
standing in the stern, and on his turning round, discharged
his piece at him. When the smoke, which for a moment
obstructed the vision, was dissipated, he was seen lying on
his back, and appeared to be severely, perhaps mortally
wounded.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the boat now drifted near to the shore,
where the Indians were collected, and a large concourse,
probably between four and five hundred, were seen rushing
down on the bank. Ray and Plascut, the only men remaining
unhurt, were placed at the oars, and as the boat
was not more than twenty yards from the shore, it was
deemed prudent for all to lie down in as safe a position as
possible, and attempt to push forward with the utmost
practicable rapidity. While they continued in this situation,
nine balls were shot into one oar, and ten into the
other, without wounding the rowers, who were hidden from
view, and protected by the side of the boat and the blankets
in its stern. During this dreadful exposure to the fire of
the savages, which continued about twenty minutes, Mr.
Kilpatrick observed a particular Indian, whom he thought
a favorable mark for his rifle, and, notwithstanding the
solemn warning of Captain Hubbell, rose to shoot him,
he immediately received a ball in his mouth, which passed
out at the back part of his head, and was almost at the
same moment shot through the heart. He fell among the
horses that about the same time were killed, and presented
to his afflicted daughters and fellow-travellers, who were
witnesses of the awful occurrence, a spectacle of horror
which we need not further attempt to describe.</p>
<p>The boat was now providentially and suddenly carried
out into the middle of the stream, and taken by the current
beyond the reach of the enemy&#8217;s balls. Our little band
reduced as they were in numbers, wounded, afflicted, and
almost exhausted by fatigue, were still unsubdued in spirit,
and being assembled in all their strength, men, women,
and children, with an appearance of triumph gave three
hearty cheers, calling to the Indians to come on again, if
they were fond of the sport.</p>
<p>Thus ended this awful conflict, in which out of nine
men, two only escaped unhurt. Tucker and Kilpatrick
were killed on the spot, Stoner was mortally wounded, and
died on his arrival at Limestone, and all the rest, excepting
Ray and Plascut were severely wounded. The women and
children were all uninjured, excepting a little son of Mr.
Plascut, who, after the battle was over, came to the captain,
and with great coolness requested him to take a ball out
of his head. On examination, it appeared that a bullet
which had passed through the side of the boat, had penetrated
the forehead of this little hero, and remained under
the skin. The captain took it out, and the youth, observing
&#8220;that is not all,&#8221; raised his arm, and exhibited a piece of
bone at the point of his elbow, which had been shot off, and
hung only by the skin. His mother exclaimed, &#8220;why did
you not tell me of this?&#8221; &#8220;Because,&#8221; he coolly replied,
&#8220;the captain directed us to be silent during the action, and
I thought you would be likely to make a noise if I told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boat made the best of its way down the river, and
reached Limestone that night. From that time forth no
boat was assailed by Indians on the Ohio.</p>

<h2>Murder of Cornstalk and his Son.</h2>
</div>

<p>Cornstalk, the commander of the Indians in the battle
of Point Pleasant, was possessed of a noble heart as well
as a genius for war and negotiation. He was ever anxious
to maintain an honorable place with the whites and they returned
his friendly inclination by putting him to death.</p>
<p>A Captain Arbuckle commanded the garrison of the fort,
erected at Point Pleasant, after the battle fought by General
Lewis with the Indians at that place, in October,
1774. In the succeeding year, when the revolutionary war
had commenced, the agents of Great Britain exerted themselves
to excite the Indians to hostility against the United
States. The mass of Shawnees entertained a strong animosity
against the Americans. But, two of their chiefs,
Cornstalk and Redhawk, not participating in that animosity
visited the garrison at the Point, where Arbuckle continued
to command. Cornstalk represented his unwillingness to
take a part in the war, on the British side: but stated,
that his nation, except himself and his tribe, were determined
on war with us, and he supposed, that he and his
people would be compelled to go with the stream. On this
intimation, Arbuckle resolved to detain the two chiefs, and
a third Shawnees, who came with them to the fort, as
hostages, under the expectation of preventing thereby any
hostile efforts of the nation. On the day before these unfortunate
Indians fell victims to the fury of the garrison,
Elenipsico, the son of Cornstalk, repaired to Point Pleasant
for the purpose of visiting his father, and on the next day,
two men belonging to the garrison, whose names were
Hamilton and Gillmore, crossed the Kenhawa, intending
to hunt in the woods beyond it.&mdash;On their return from
hunting, some Indians who had come to view the position
at the Point, concealed themselves in the weeds near the
mouth of the Kenhawa, and killed Gillmore while endeavoring
to pass them. Colonel Stewart and Captain Arbuckle
were standing on the opposite bank of the river, at
that time and were surprised that a gun had been fired so
near the fort, in violation of orders which had been issued
inhibiting such an act. Hamilton ran down the bank, and
cried out that Gillmore was killed. Captain Hall commanded
the company to which Gillmore belonged. His
men leaped into a canoe, and hastened to the relief of
Hamilton. They brought the body of Gillmore weltering
in blood, and the head scalped, across the river. The canoe
had scarcely reached the shore, when Hall&#8217;s men cried out
&#8220;Let us kill the Indians in the fort.&#8221; Captain Hall placed
himself in front of his soldiers, and they ascended the
river&#8217;s bank, pale with rage, and carrying their loaded fire
locks in their hands. Colonel Stewart and Captain Arbuckle
exerted themselves in vain, to dissuade these men, exasperated
to madness by the spectacle of Gillmore&#8217;s corpse,
from the cruel deed which they contemplated. They cocked
their guns, threatening those gentlemen with instant death,
if they did not desist, and rushed into the fort.</p>
<p>The interpreter&#8217;s wife, who had been a captive among
the Indians, and felt an affection for them, ran to their
cabin and informed them that Hall&#8217;s soldiers were advancing
with the intention of taking their lives, because they
believed that the Indians who killed Gillmore, had come
with Cornstalk&#8217;s son the preceding day. This the young
man solemnly denied, and averred that he knew nothing
of them. His father, perceiving that Elenipsico was in
great agitation, encouraged him and advised him not to
fear. &#8220;If the great Spirit,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has sent you here to
be killed, you ought to die like a man!&#8221; As the soldiers
approached the door, Cornstalk rose to meet them, and
received seven or eight balls which instantly terminated
his existence. His son was shot dead in the seat which he
occupied. The Red Hawk made an attempt to climb the
chimney, but fell by the fire of some of Hall&#8217;s men. The
other Indian, says Colonel Stewart, &#8220;was shamefully mangled,
and I grieved to see him so long dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>This atrocious deed so exasperated the Shawnees that
they immediately took up arms upon the side of the British,
expressing their resolution to spare no American who should
fall into their hands, and never to lay down arms while
there was the remotest chance of successful hostility. Many
a family in Virginia and Kentucky had reason to lament
the slaughter of the noble Cornstalk and his son.</p>

<h2>The Massacre of Chicago.</h2>
</div>

<p>On the site of the present city of Chicago, a fort was
erected in 1803. Feeling secure under this protection,
several families built cabins and began to cultivate the
ground in the vicinity. The large and powerful tribe of
Pottawatomies occupied the neighboring country. When
the war of 1812 broke out, the fort at Chicago was garrisoned
by about fifty men, under the command of Captain
Heald, and as it was so remote from the other American
posts, General Hull determined that it should be abandoned.
The following account of the subsequent disastrous events
is abridged from Brown&#8217;s History of Illinois.</p>
<p>On the 7th of August, 1812, in the afternoon, Winnemeg,
or Catfish, a friendly Indian of the Pottawatomie
tribe, arrived at Chicago, and brought dispatches from
General Hull, containing the first, and, at that time, the only
intelligence of the declaration of war. General Hull&#8217;s
letter announced the capture of Mackinaw, and directed
Captain Heald &#8220;to evacuate the fort at Chicago, if practicable,
and, in that event, to distribute all the United
States property contained in the fort, and the United States
factory or agency, among the Indians in the neighborhood
and repair to Fort Wayne.&#8221; Winnemeg having delivered
his dispatches to Captain Heald, and stated that he was
acquainted with the purport of the communication he had
brought, urged upon Captain Heald the policy of remaining
in the fort, being supplied, as they were, with ammunition
and provisions for a considerable time. In case,
however, Captain Heald thought proper to evacuate the
place, he urged upon him the propriety of doing so immediately,
before the Pottawatomies (through whose country
they must pass, and who were as yet ignorant of the object
of his mission) could collect a force sufficient to oppose
them. This advice though given in great earnestness, was
not sufficiently regarded by Captain Heald; who observed,
that he should evacuate the fort, but having received orders
to distribute the public property among the Indians, he did
not feel justified in leaving it until he had collected the
Pottawatomies in its vicinity, and made an equitable
distribution among them. Winnemeg then suggested the expediency
of marching out and leaving every thing standing;
&#8220;while the Indians,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are dividing the spoils, the
troops will be able to retreat without molestation.&#8221; This
advice was also unheeded, and an order for evacuating the
fort was read next morning on parade. Captain Heald,
in issuing it, had neglected to consult his junior officers, as
it would have been natural for him to do in such an emergency,
and as he probably would have done had there not
been some coolness between him and Ensign Ronan.</p>

CAPTAIN HEALD IN COUNCIL WITH THE POTTAWATAMIES.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The lieutenant and ensign, after the promulgation of
this order, waited on Captain Heald to learn his intentions;
and being apprized; for the first time, of the course he intended
to pursue, they remonstrated against it. Heald,
however, deemed it advisable to assemble the Indians and
distribute the public property among them, and ask of
them an escort thither, with the promise of a considerable
sum of money to be paid on their safe arrival; adding,
that he had perfect confidence in the friendly professions
of the Indians, from whom, as well as from the soldiers,
the capture of Mackinaw had studiously been concealed.
From this time forward, the junior officers stood aloof from
their commander, and, considering his project as little
short of madness, conversed as little upon the subject as
possible. Dissatisfaction, however, soon filled the camp;
the soldiers began to murmur, and insubordination assumed
a threatening aspect.</p>
<p>The savages, in the mean time became more and more
troublesome; entered the fort occasionally, in defiance of
the sentinels, and even made their way without ceremony
into the quarters of its commanding officer. On one occasion
an Indian, taking up a rifle fired it in the parlor of
Captain Heald; some were of opinion that this was intended
as the signal for an attack. The old chiefs at this time
passed back and forth among the assembled groups, apparently
agitated; and the squaws seemed much excited, as
though some terrible calamity was impending. No further
manifestations, however, of ill-feeling were exhibited, and
the day passed without bloodshed. So infatuated at this
time was Captain Heald, that he supposed he had wrought
a favorable impression upon the savages, and that the little
garrison could now march forth in safety.</p>
<p>The Indians from the adjacent villages having at length
arrived, a council was held on the 12th of August. It was
attended, however, only by Captain Heald on the part of
the military; the other officers refused to attend, having
previously learned that a massacre was intended. This
fact was communicated to Captain Heald; he insisted,
however, on their going, and they resolutely persisted in
their refusal. When Captain Heald left the fort, they repaired
to the block-house, which overlooked the ground
where the council was in session, and opening the portholes,
pointed their cannon in its direction. This circumstance
and their absence, it is supposed, saved the whites
from massacre.</p>

BATTLE BETWEEN MOUNTED TROOPS AND THE INDIANS.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Heald informed the Indians in council, that he
would next day distribute among them all the goods in the
United States factory, together with the ammunition and
provisions with which the garrison was supplied; and desired
of them an escort to Fort Wayne, promising them a
reward on their arrival thither, in addition to the presents
they were about to receive. The savages assented, with
professions of friendship, to all he proposed, and promised
all he required.</p>
<p>The council was no sooner dismissed, than several observing
the tone of feeling which prevailed, and anticipating
from it no good to the garrison, waited on Captain
Heald in order to open his eyes, if possible, to their condition.
The impolicy of furnishing the Indians with arms
and ammunition to be used against themselves, struck Captain
Heald with so much force, that he resolved, without
consulting his officers, to destroy all not required for immediate
use.</p>
<p>On August 13th, the goods in the factory store were
distributed among the Indians, who had collected near the
fort; and in the evening the ammunition, and also the
liquor, belonging to the garrison, were carried, the former
into the sally-port and thrown into the well, and the latter
through the south gate, as silently as possible, to the river
bank, where the heads of the barrels were knocked in, and
their contents discharged into the stream. The Indians,
however, suspecting the game, approached as near as possible
and witnessed the whole scene. The spare muskets
were broken up and thrown into the well, together with
bags of shot, flints, and gun-screws, and other things; all,
however, of but little value.</p>
<p>On the 14th, the despondency of the garrison was for a
while dispelled by the arrival of Captain Wells and fifteen
friendly Miamies. Having heard at Fort Wayne of the
error to evacuate Chicago, and knowing the hostile intentions
of the Pottawatomies, he hastened thither in order
to save, if possible, the little garrison from its doom.
Having, on his arrival, learned that the ammunition had
been destroyed, and the provisions distributed among the
Indians, he saw there was no alternative. Preparations
were therefore made for marching on the morrow.</p>
<p>In the afternoon a second council was held with the
Indians, at which they expressed their resentment at the
destruction of the ammunition and liquor in the severest
terms. Notwithstanding the precautions which had been
observed, the knocking in of the heads of the whisky-barrels
had been heard by the Indians, and the river next
morning tasted, as some of them expressed it, &#8220;like strong
grog.&#8221; Murmurs and threats were everywhere heard;
and nothing, apparently, was wanting but an opportunity
for some public manifestation of their resentment.</p>
<p>The morning of the 15th dawned as usual; the sun rose
with uncommon splendor, and Lake Michigan &#8220;was a sheet
of burnished gold.&#8221; Early in the day a message was received
in the American camp from To-pee-na-bee, a chief
of the St. Joseph&#8217;s band, informing them that mischief
was brewing among the Pottawatomies, who had promised
them protection.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 329px;'>
TO-PEE-NA-BEE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>About nine o&#8217;clock, the troops left the fort with martial
music, and in military array. Captain Wells, at the head
of the Miamies, led the van, his face blackened after the
manner of the Indians. The garrison, with loaded arms,
followed, and the wagons with the baggage, the women and
children, the sick and the lame, closed the rear. The Pottawatomies,
about five hundred in number, who had
promised to escort them in safety to Fort Wayne leaving a
little space, afterward followed. The party in advance
took the beach road. They had no sooner arrived at the
sand-hills which separate the prairie from the beach, about
a mile and a half from the fort, when the Pottawatomies,
instead of continuing in rear of the Americans, left the
beach and took to the prairie; the sand-hills of course
intervened, and presented a barrier between the Pottawatomies
and the American and Miami line of march. This
divergence had scarcely been effected, when Captain Wells,
who, with the Miamies was considerably in advance, rode
back and exclaimed, &#8220;They are about to attack us; form
instantly and charge upon them.&#8221; The word had scarcely
been uttered, before a volley of musketry from behind the
sand-hills was poured in upon them. The troops were
brought immediately into a line and charged upon the bank.
One man, a veteran of seventy, fell as they ascended. The
battle at once became general. The Miamies fled in the
outset; their chief rode up to the Pottawatomies, charged
them with duplicity, and, brandishing his tomahawk, said,
&#8220;he would be the first to head a party of Americans, and
return to punish them for their treachery.&#8221; He then turned
his horse and galloped off in pursuit of his companions, who
were then scouring across the prairie, and nothing was seen
or heard of them more.</p>
<p>The American troops behaved gallantly; though few in
number, they sold their lives as dearly as possible. They
felt, however, as if their time had come, and sought to forget
all that was dear on earth.</p>
<p>While the battle was raging, the surgeon, Doctor Voorhes,
who was badly wounded, and whose horse had been shot
from under him, approaching Mrs. Helm, the wife of Lieutenant
Helm, (who was in the action, participating in all
its vicissitudes,) observed, &#8220;Do you think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they
will take our lives? I am badly wounded, but I think not
mortally. Perhaps we can purchase safety by offering a
large reward. Do you think,&#8221; continued he, &#8220;there is any
chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Voorhes,&#8221; replied Mrs. Helm, &#8220;let us not waste
the few moments which yet remain in idle or ill-founded
hopes. Our fate is inevitable; we must soon appear at
the bar of God; let us make such preparations as are yet
in our power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I cannot die; I am unfit to die! If
I had a short time to prepare! Death! oh, how awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment, Ensign Ronan was fighting at a little
distance with a tall and portly Indian; the former, mortally
wounded, was nearly down, and struggling desperately
upon one knee. Mrs. Helm, pointing her finger, and directing
the attention of Doctor Voorhes thither, observed,
&#8220;Look,&#8221; said she, &#8220;at that young man; he dies like a
soldier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Doctor Voorhes, &#8220;but he has no terrors of
the future; he is an unbeliever.&#8221;</p>

THE MASSACRE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>A young savage immediately raised his tomahawk to
strike Mrs. Helm. She sprang instantly aside, and the
blow intended for her head fell upon her shoulder; she
thereupon seized him around his neck, and while exerting
all her efforts to get possession of his scalping-knife, was
seized by another Indian and dragged forcibly from his
grasp. The latter bore her, struggling and resisting, toward
the lake. Notwithstanding, however, the rapidity
with which she was hurried along, she recognized, as she
passed, the remains of the unfortunate surgeon stretched
lifeless on the prairie. She was plunged immediately into
the water and held there, notwithstanding her resistance,
with a forcible hand. She shortly, however, perceived that
the intention of her captor was not to drown her, as he held
her in a position to keep her head above the water. Thus
reassured, she looked at him attentively, and, in spite of
his disguise, recognized the &#8220;white man&#8217;s friend.&#8221; It was
Black Partridge.</p>
<p>When the firing had ceased, her preserver bore her from
the water and conducted her up the sand-bank. It was a
beautiful day in August. The heat, however, of the sun
was oppressive; and, walking through the sand, exposed
to its burning rays, in her drenched condition&mdash;weary, and
exhausted by efforts beyond her strength&mdash;anxious beyond
measure to learn the fate of her friends, and alarmed for
her own, her situation was one of agony.</p>
<p>The troops having fought with desperation till two-thirds
of their number were slain, the remainder twenty-seven in
all, borne down by an overwhelming force, and exhausted
by efforts hitherto unequalled, at length surrendered. They
stipulated, however, for their own safety and for the safety
of their remaining women and children. The wounded
prisoners, however, in the hurry of the moment, were unfortunately
omitted, or rather not particularly mentioned
and were therefore regarded by the Indians as having been
excluded.</p>
<p>One of the soldiers&#8217; wives, having frequently been told
that prisoners taken by the Indians were subjected to tortures
worse than death, had from the first expressed a resolution
never to be taken; and when a party of savages
approached to make her their prisoner, she fought with
desperation; and, though assured of kind treatment and
protection, refused to surrender, and was literally cut in
pieces and her mangled remains left on the field.</p>
<p>After the surrender, one of the baggage wagons, containing
twelve children, was assailed by a single savage
and the whole number were massacred. All, without distinction
of age or sex, fell at once beneath his murderous
tomahawk.</p>
<p>Captain Wells, who had as yet escaped unharmed, saw
from a distance the whole of this murderous scene; and
being apprized of the stipulation, and seeing it thus violated,
exclaimed aloud, so as to be heard by the Pottawatomies
around him, whose prisoner he then was, &#8220;If this be your
game, I will kill too!&#8221; and turning his horse&#8217;s head, instantly
started for the Pottawatomie camp, where the
squaws and Indian children had been left ere the battle
began. He had no sooner started, than several Indians
followed in his rear and discharged their rifles at him as
he galloped across the prairie. He laid himself flat on the
neck of his horse, and was apparently out of their reach,
when the ball of one of his pursuers took effect, killing his
horse and wounding him severely. He was again a prisoner;
as the savages came up, Winnemeg and Wa-ban-see,
two of their number, and both his friends, used all their
endeavors in order to save him; they had disengaged him
already from his horse, and were supporting him along,
when Pee-so-tum, a Pottawatomie Indian, drawing his
scalping-knife, stabbed him in the back, and thus inflicted
a mortal wound. After struggling for a moment he fell,
and breathed his last in the arms of his friends, a victim
for those he had sought to save&mdash;a sacrifice to his own rash
intentions.</p>

WINNEMEG, OR THE CATFISH.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The battle having ended, and the prisoners being secured,
the latter were conducted to the Pottawatomie camp
near the fort. Here the wife of Wau-bee-nee-mah, an Illinois
chief, perceiving the exhausted condition of Mrs.
Helm, took a kettle, and dipping up some water from the
stream which flowed sluggishly by them, threw into it some
maple sugar, and, stirring it up with her hand, gave her
to drink. &#8220;It was,&#8221; says Mrs. Helm, &#8220;the most delicious
draught I had ever taken, and her kindness of manner,
amid so much atrocity, touched my heart.&#8221; Her attention,
however, was soon directed to other objects. The fort,
after the troops had marched out, became a scene of plunder.
The cattle were shot down as they ran at large, and lay
dead, or were dying around her. It called up afresh a
remark of Ensign Ronan&#8217;s, made before; &#8220;Such,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;is to be our fate&mdash;to be shot down like brutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded prisoners, we have already remarked, were
not included in the stipulation made on the battle-field, as
the <i>Indians understood it</i>. On reaching, therefore, the
Pottawatomie camp, a scene followed which beggars description.
A wounded soldier, lying on the ground, was
violently assaulted by an old squaw, infuriated by the loss
of friends or excited by the murderous scenes around her&mdash;who,
seizing a pitchfork, attacked the wretched victim, now
helpless, and exposed to the burning rays of the sun, his
wounds already aggravated by its heat, and he writhing
in torture. During the succeeding night, five other wounded
prisoners were tomahawked.</p>
<p>Those unwounded remained in the wigwams of their
captors. The work of plunder being now completed, the
fort next day was set on fire. A fair and equal distribution
of all the finery belonging to the garrison had apparently
been made, and shawls and ribands and feathers
were scattered about the camp in great profusion.</p>
<p>After suffering many hardships, Mrs. Helm, Mrs. Heald,
and the surviving male prisoners were ransomed and sent
back to their friends. A few of them, however, were not
set at liberty until after the battle of the Thames.</p>

<h2>The Two Friends.</h2>
</div>

<p>In August, 1786, Mr. Francis Downing, then a lad,
was living in a fort, where subsequently some iron works
were erected by Mr. Jacob Myers, which are now known
by the name of Slate Creek works. About the 16th, a
young man belonging to the fort, called upon Downing,
and requested his assistance in hunting for a horse which
had strayed away on the preceding evening. Downing
readily complied, and the two friends traversed the woods
in every direction, until at length, towards evening, they
found themselves in a wild valley, at a distance of six or
seven miles from the fort. Here Downing became alarmed
and repeatedly assured his elder companion, (whose name
was Yates,) that he heard sticks cracking behind them,
and was confident that Indians were dogging them. Yates,
being an experienced hunter, and from habit grown indifferent
to the dangers of the woods, diverted himself freely
at the expense of his young companion, often inquiring,
at what price he rated his scalp, and offering to ensure it
for sixpence. Downing, however, was not so easily satisfied.
He observed, that in whatever direction they turned, the
same ominous sounds continued to haunt them, and as
Yates still treated his fears with the most perfect indifference,
he determined to take his measures upon his own
responsibility. Gradually slackening his pace, he permitted
Yates to advance twenty or thirty steps in front of him,
and immediately after descending a gentle hill, he suddenly
sprung aside and hid himself in a thick cluster of whortleberry
bushes. Yates, who at that time was performing
some woodland ditty to the full extent of his lungs, was
too much pleased with his own voice, to attend either to
Downing or the Indians, and was quickly out of sight.
Scarcely had he disappeared, when Downing, to his unspeakable
terror, beheld two savages put aside the stalks
of a canebrake, and looked out cautiously in the direction
which Yates had taken. Fearful that they had seen him
step aside, he determined to fire upon them, and trust to
his heels for safety, but so unsteady was his hand, that in
raising his gun to his shoulder, she went off before he had
taken aim. He lost no time in following her example, and
after having run fifty yards, he met Yates, who, alarmed
at the report, was hastily retracing his steps. It was not
necessary to inquire what was the matter. The enemy
were in full view, pressing forward with great rapidity, and
&#8220;devil take the hindmost,&#8221; was the order of the day. Yates
would not outstrip Downing, but ran by his side, although
in so doing, he risked both of their lives. The Indians
were well acquainted with the country, and soon took a
path that diverged from the one which the whites followed,
at one point and rejoined it at another, bearing the same
relation to it that the string does to the bow. The two
paths were at no point distant from each other more than
one hundred yards, so that Yates and Downing could easily
see the enemy gaining rapidly upon them. They reached
the point of re-union first, however, and quickly came to
a deep gully which it was necessary to recross, or retrace
their steps. Yates cleared it without difficulty, but Downing
being, much exhausted, fell short, falling with his breast
against the opposite brink, rebounded with violence, and
fell at full length on the bottom. The Indians crossed the
ditch a few yards below him, and, eager for the capture
of Yates, continued the pursuit, without appearing to notice
Downing. The latter who at first had given himself up
for lost, quickly recovered his strength, and began to walk
slowly along the ditch, fearing to leave it lest the enemy
should see him. As he advanced, however, the ditch became
more shallow, until at length it ceased to protect him
at all. Looking around cautiously, he saw one of the Indians
returning apparently in quest of him. Unfortunately,
he had neglected to reload his gun, while in the ditch, and
as the Indian instantly advanced upon him, he had no resource
but flight. Throwing away his gun, which was now
useless, he plied his legs manfully, in ascending a long
ridge which stretched before him, but the Indian gained
upon him so rapidly, that he lost all hope of escape. Coming
at length to a large poplar which had been blown up by
the roots, he ran along the body of the tree upon one side
while the Indian followed it upon the other, doubtless expecting
to intercept him at the root. It happened that a
large she bear was sucking her cubs in a bed which she had
made at the root of the tree, and as the Indian reached
that point, she instantly sprung upon him, and a prodigious
uproar took place. The Indian yelled, and stabbed
with his knife, the bear growled and saluted him with one
of her most endearing &#8220;hugs;&#8221;&mdash;while Downing, fervently
wishing her success, ran off through the woods, without
waiting to see the event of the struggle. Downing reached
the fort in safety, and found Yates reposing after a hot
chase, having eluded his pursuers, and gained the fort two
hours before him. On the next morning, they collected a
party and returned to the poplar tree, but no traces either
of the Indian or bear were to be found. They both probably
escaped with their lives, although not without injury.</p>

<h2>Desertion of a young White Man, from a party of Indians.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the year 1787, the following incident occurred in
Bourbon county Kentucky. One morning, about sun rise,
a young man of wild and savage appearance, suddenly arose
from a cluster of bushes in front of a cabin, and hailed the
house in a barbarous dialect, which seemed neither exactly
Indian nor English, but a collection of shreds and patches
from which the graces of both were carefully excluded.
His skin had evidently once been white&mdash;although now
grievously tanned by constant exposure to the weather.
His dress in every respect was that of an Indian, as were
his gestures, tones and equipments, and his age could not
be supposed to exceed twenty years. He talked volubly,
but uncouthly, placed his hand upon his breast, gestured
vehemently, and seemed very earnestly bent upon communicating
something. He was invited to enter the cabin,
and the neighbors quickly collected around him. He appeared
involuntarily to shrink from contact with them&mdash;his
eyes rolled rapidly around with a distrustful expression
from one to the other, and his whole manner was that of
a wild animal, just caught, and shrinking from the touch
of its captors.&mdash;As several present understood the Indian
tongue, they at length gathered the following circumstances
as accurately as they could be translated, out of a language
which seemed to be an &#8220;omnium gatherum&#8221; of all that was
mongrel, uncouth and barbarous. He said that he had
been taken by the Indians, when a child, but could neither
recollect his name, nor the country of his birth.&mdash;That he
had been adopted by an Indian warrior, who brought him
up with his other sons, without making the slightest difference
between them, and that under his father&#8217;s roof, he
had lived happily until within the last month. A few weeks
before that time, his father, accompanied by himself and
a younger brother, had hunted for some time upon the
waters of the Miami, about forty miles from the spot where
Cincinnati now stands, and after all their meat, skins, &amp;c.,
had been properly secured, the old man determined to
gratify his children by taking them upon a war expedition
to Kentucky. They accordingly built a bark canoe, in
which they crossed the Ohio, near the mouth of Licking,
and having buried it, so as to secure it from the action of
the sun, they advanced into the country and encamped at
the distance of fifteen miles from the river. Here their
father was alarmed by hearing an owl cry in a peculiar
tone, which he declared boded death or captivity to themselves,
if they continued their expedition&mdash;and announced
his intention of returning without delay to the river. Both
of his sons vehemently opposed this resolution, and at
length prevailed upon the old man to disregard the owl&#8217;s
warning, and conduct them, as he had promised, against
the frontiers of Kentucky. The party then composed
themselves to sleep, but were quickly awakened by the
father, who had again been warned in a dream that death
awaited them in Kentucky, and again besought his children
to release him from his promise and lose no time in returning
home. Again they prevailed upon him to disregard
the warning, and persevere in the march. He consented
to gratify them, but declared he would not remain
a moment longer in the camp which they now occupied,
and accordingly they left it immediately, and marched on
through the night, directing their course towards Bourbon
county. In the evening they approached a house, that
which he hailed and in which he was now speaking. Suddenly
the desire of rejoining his people occupied his mind
so strongly as to exclude every other idea, and seizing the
first favorable opportunity, he had concealed himself in
the bushes, and neglected to reply to all the signals which
had been concerted for the purpose of collecting their party
when scattered. This account appeared so extraordinary,
and the young man&#8217;s appearance was so wild and suspicious,
that many of the neighbors suspected him of treachery, and
thought that he should be arrested as a spy. Others opposed
this resolution and gave full credit to his narrative.
In order to satisfy themselves, however, they insisted upon
his immediately conducting them to the spot where the
canoe had been buried. To this the young man objected
most vehemently, declaring that although he had deserted
his father and brother, yet he would not betray them.
These feelings were too delicate to meet with much sympathy
from the rude borderers who surrounded him, and
he was given to understand that nothing short of conducting
them to the point of embarkation, would be accepted as an
evidence of his sincerity.&mdash;With obvious reluctance he at
length complied. From twenty to thirty men were quickly
assembled, mounted upon good horses, and under the
guidance of the deserter, they moved rapidly towards the
mouth of Licking. On the road the young man informed
them that he would first conduct them to the spot, where
they had encamped when the scream of the owl alarmed
his father, and where an iron kettle had been concealed in
a hollow tree. He was probably induced to do this from
the hope of delaying the pursuit so long as to afford his
friends an opportunity of crossing the river in safety. But
if such was his intention, no measure could have been more
unfortunate.</p>

THE SURPRISE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The whites approached the encampment in deep silence,
and quickly perceived two Indians, an old man and a boy,
seated by the fire and busily engaged in cooking some
venison.&mdash;The deserter became much agitated at the sight
of them, and so earnestly implored his countrymen not to
kill them, that it was agreed to surround the encampment,
and endeavor to secure them as prisoners. This was accordingly
attempted, but so desperate was the resistance
of the Indians, and so determined were their efforts to escape,
that the whites were compelled to fire upon them,
and the old man fell mortally wounded, while the boy, by
an incredible display of address and activity, was enabled
to escape. The deserter beheld his father fall, and throwing
himself from his horse, he ran up to the spot where the
old man lay bleeding, but still sensible, and falling upon
his body, besought his forgiveness for being the unwilling
cause of his death, and wept bitterly. His father evidently
recognized him, and gave him his hand, but almost instantly
afterwards expired. The white men now called
upon him to conduct them at a gallop to the spot where
the canoe was buried, expecting to reach it before the Indian
boy and intercept him. The deserter in vain implored
them to compassionate his feelings. He urged that he had
already sufficiently demonstrated the truth of his former
assertions, at the expense of his father&#8217;s life, and earnestly
entreated them to permit his younger brother to escape.
His companions, however, were inexorable. Nothing but
the blood of the young Indian would satisfy them, and the
deserter was again compelled to act in the capacity of a
guide.</p>
<p>Within two hours they reached the designated spot.
The canoe was still there, and no track could be seen upon
the sand, so that it was evident that their victim had not
yet arrived. Hastily dismounting, they tied their horses
and concealed themselves within close rifle shot of the
canoe. Within ten minutes after their arrival the Indian
appeared in sight, walking swiftly towards them. He went
straight to the spot where the canoe had been buried, and
was in the act of digging it up, when he received a dozen
balls through his body, and leaping high into the air fell
dead upon the sand. He was scalped and buried where
he fell, without having seen his brother, and probably
without having known the treachery by which he and his
father had lost their lives. The deserter remained but a
short time in Bourbon, and never regained his tranquillity
of mind. He shortly afterwards disappeared, but whether
to seek his relations in Virginia or Pennsylvania, or whether
disgusted by the ferocity of the whites, he returned to the
Indians, has never yet been known. He was never heard
of afterwards.</p>

<h2>Morgan&#8217;s Triumph.</h2>
</div>

<p>In 1779, a Mr. Morgan, of Prickett&#8217;s Fort, West Virginia,
was surprised in the woods by two Indians, who
immediately gave chase. Being old and somewhat infirm,
he faltered in the race, and was obliged to take refuge
behind a tree; the Indians did the same, but one of them
exposing his body, was shot by Morgan, and, after falling,
stabbed himself. Morgan again fled; but his surviving
antagonist gained rapidly upon him, and at length raised
his gun to fire. Morgan adroitly stepped aside, and the
ball passed him. Then each rushed to closer combat.</p>
<p>Morgan, while striking with his gun, received the Indian&#8217;s
tomahawk, which cut off a finger, and knocked the gun
from his grasp. Being an expert wrestler, he closed, and
threw his antagonist; but he was speedily overturned,
when the Indian, uttering the customary yell of triumph,
began feeling for his knife. Its hilt was entangled in a
woman&#8217;s apron, which the savage had tied round his
waist; and this apparent trivial circumstance saved the
prostrate hunter. During the search, Morgan had seized
his antagonist&#8217;s fingers with his teeth, a position in which
he used all becoming exertions to keep them. Meanwhile
he assisted in the search for the knife. The Indian at
length seized it, but so far towards the blade, that Morgan
caught hold of the upper portion of the handle, and
drew it through his adversary&#8217;s hand, inflicting a deep
wound. Both sprang erect, Morgan still holding on to
the Indian&#8217;s fingers, and having his body within his grasp.
He had therefore all the advantage, and while his foe was
struggling to disengage himself, he plunged the knife to
the hilt in his body. The daring hunter returned to the
fort in triumph.</p>

<h2>Massacre of Wyoming.</h2>
</div>

<p>The following account of the battle and massacre is
taken from an interesting history of Wyoming, written by
Isaac Chapman, Esq., late of Wilkesbarre. Judge Chapman
lived upon the spot, and could hardly fail to have
collected ample materials, and to give a correct narrative
of the events which transpired there during the Revolutionary
war. The inhabitants had collected in Forty
Fort&mdash;the principal fort in the valley. The number of
men was three hundred and sixty-eight.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3d of July, 1778, the officers
of the garrison of Forty Fort held a council to determine
on the propriety of marching from the fort, and attacking
the enemy wherever found. The debates in this council
of war are said to have been conducted with much warmth
and animation. The ultimate determination was one on
which depended the lives of the garrison and safety of
the settlement. On one side it was contended that their
enemies were daily increasing in numbers; that they would
plunder the settlement of all kinds of property, and would
accumulate the means of carrying on the war, while they
themselves would become weaker; that the harvest would
soon be ripe, and would be gathered or destroyed by their
enemies, and all their means of sustenance during the
succeeding winter would fail; that probably all their
messengers were killed, and as there had been more than
sufficient time, and no assistance arrived, they would probably
receive none, and consequently now was the proper
time to make an attack.</p>
<p>On the other side it was argued, that probably some or
all the messengers may have arrived at head-quarters,
but that the absence of the commander-in-chief may have
produced delay; that one or two weeks more may bring
the desired assistance, and that to attack the enemy, superior
as they were in number, out of the limits of their
own fort, would produce almost certain destruction to the
settlements and themselves, and captivity, and slavery,
perhaps torture, to their wives and children.</p>

THE MASSACRE OF WYOMING.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>While these debates were progressing, five men belonging
to Wyoming, but who at that time held commissions
in the continental army, arrived at the fort; they had
received information that a force from Niagara had
marched to destroy the settlements on the Susquehanna,
and being unable to bring with them any reinforcement,
they resigned their appointments, and hastened immediately
to the protection of their families. They had heard
nothing of the messengers, neither could they give any
certain information as to the probability of relief.</p>
<p>The prospect of receiving assistance became now extremely
uncertain. The advocates for the attack prevailed
in the council, and at dawn of day, on the morning of
the 3d of July, the garrison left the fort, and began their
march up the river, under the command of Colonel Zebulon
Butler. Having proceeded about two miles, the troops
halted for the purpose of detaching a reconnoitering party,
to ascertain the situation of the enemy.</p>
<p>The scout found the enemy in possession of Fort Wintermoot,
and occupying huts immediately around it, carousing
in supposed security; but on their return to the advancing
column, they met two strolling Indians, by whom
they were fired upon, and upon whom they immediately
returned the fire without effect. The settlers hastened
their march for the attack, but the Indians had given the
alarm, and the advancing troops found the enemy already
formed in order of battle a small distance from their fort,
with their right flank covered by a swamp, and their left
resting upon the bank of a river. The settlers immediately
displayed their column and formed in corresponding
order, but as the enemy was much superior in numbers,
their line was much more extensive. Pine woods and
bushes covered the battle-ground, in consequence of
which, the movements of the troops could not be so quickly
discovered, nor so well ascertained. Colonel Zebulon
Butler had command of the right, and was opposed by
Colonel John Butler at the head of the British troops on
the left, Colonel Nathan Denison commanded the left,
opposed by Brant at the head of his Indians on the enemy&#8217;s
right. The battle commenced at about forty rods distant,
and continued about fifteen minutes through the woods
and brush without much execution. At this time, Brant
with his Indians having penetrated the swamp, turned
the left flank of the settler&#8217;s line, and with a terrible war-whoop
and savage yell, made a desperate charge upon the
troops composing that wing, which fell very fast, and
were immediately cut to pieces with the tomahawk. Colonel
Denison having ascertained that the savages were
gaining the rear of the left, gave orders for that wing
<i>to fall back</i>. At the same time, Colonel John Butler, finding
that the line of settlers did not extend so far towards
the river as his own, doubled that end of his line which
was protected by a thick growth of brushwood, and having
brought a party of his British regulars to act in
column upon that wing, threw Colonel Zebulon Butler&#8217;s
into some confusion. The orders of Colonel Denison for
his troops to fall back, having been understood by many
to mean a retreat, the troops began to retire in much disorder.
The savages considered this a flight, and commencing
a most hideous yell, rushed forward with their
rifles and tomahawks, and cut the retiring line to pieces.
In this situation it was found impossible to rally and
form the troops, and the rout became general throughout
the line.</p>
<p>The settlers fled in every direction, and were instantly
followed by the savages, who killed or took prisoners whoever
came within their reach. Some succeeded in reaching
the river, and escaped by swimming across; others fled
to the mountains, and the savages, too much occupied
with plunder, gave up the pursuit.</p>
<p>When the first intelligence was received in the village
of Wilkesbarre that the battle was lost, the women fled
with their children to the mountains on their way to the
settlements on the Delaware, where many of them at length
arrived after suffering extreme hardships. Many of the
men who escaped the battle, together with their women
and children, who were unable to travel on foot, took refuge
in Wyoming fort, and on the following day (July 4th,)
Butler and Brant, at the head of their combined forces,
appeared before the fort, and demanded its surrender.
The garrison being without any efficient means of defence,
surrendered the fort on articles of capitulation, by
which the settlers, upon giving up their fortifications, prisoners,
and military stores, were to remain in the country
unmolested, provided they did not again take up arms.</p>
<p>In this battle about three hundred of the settlers were
killed or missing, from a great part of whom no intelligence
was ever afterward received.</p>
<p>The conditions of the capitulation were entirely disregarded
by the British and savage forces, and after the
fort was delivered up, all kinds of barbarities were committed
by them. The village of Wilkesbarre, consisting
of twenty-three houses, was burnt; men and their wives
were separated from each other, and carried into captivity:
their property was plundered, and the settlement laid
waste. The remainder of the inhabitants were driven
from the valley, and compelled to proceed on foot sixty
miles through the great swamp, almost without food or
clothing. A number perished in the journey, principally
women and children; some died of their wounds; others
wandered from the path in search of food, and were lost,
and those who survived called the wilderness through
which they had passed, &#8220;the shades of death!&#8221; a name
which it has since retained.</p>

<h2>Heroic Women of the West.</h2>
</div>

<p>The following incidents are taken from a letter addressed
by Captain Nathaniel Hart, of Woodford county, Kentucky,
to Governor Morehead:</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Sir.</span>&mdash;Connected with your address delivered at
the celebration of the first settlement of Kentucky, at
Boonesborough, the circumstances attending the escape
and defence of Mrs. Woods, about the year 1784-5, near
the Crab Orchard, in Lincoln county, may not be without
interest. I have a distinct recollection of them. Mr. Woods,
her husband, was absent from home, and early in the
morning, being a short distance from her cabin, she discovered
several Indians advancing towards it. She reached
it before all but one, who was so far ahead of the others,
that before she could close and fasten the door, he entered.
Instantly he was seized by a lame negro man of the family,
and after a short scuffle, they both fell&mdash;the negro underneath.
But he held the Indian so fast, that he was unable
to use either his scalping knife or tomahawk, when he called
upon his young mistress to take the axe from under the
bed, and dispatch him by a blow upon the head. She immediately
attempted it: but the first attempt was a failure
She repeated the blow and killed him. The other Indians
were at the door endeavoring to force it open with their
tomahawks. The negro rose, and proposed to Mrs. Woods
to let in another, and they would soon dispose of the whole
of them in the same way. The cabin was but a short
distance from a station, the occupants of which, having
discovered the perilous situation of the family, fired on the
Indians, and killed another, when the remainder made their
escape.</p>

MRS. DUREE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF HER HUSBAND.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This incident is not more extaordinary than one that
happened, in the fall or winter of 1781-2, to some families
belonging to our own fort at the White Oak Spring. My
father settled this fort in 1779. It was situated about a
mile above Boonesborough and in the same bottom of the
river. It was composed principally of families from York
county, Pennsylvania&mdash;orderly, respectable people, and
the men good soldiers. But they were unaccustomed to
Indian warfare, and the consequence was, that of some
ten or twelve men, all were killed but two or three. During
this period, Peter Duree, the elder, the principal man of
the connection, determined to settle a new fort between
Estill&#8217;s station and the mouth of Muddy Creek, directly
on the trace between the Cherokee and Shawnese towns.
Having erected a cabin, his son-in-law, John Bullock and
his family, and his son Peter Duree, his wife and two
children, removed to it, taking a pair of hand mill stones
with them. They remained for two or three days shut up
in their cabin, but their corn meal being exhausted, they
were compelled to venture out to cut a hollow tree in order
to adjust their hand mill. They were attacked by Indians&mdash;Bullock,
after running a short distance, fell. Duree reached
the cabin, and threw himself upon the bed. Mrs. Bullock
ran to the door to ascertain the fate of her husband&mdash;received
a shot in the breast, and fell across the door sill.
Mrs. Duree, not knowing whether her husband had been
shot or had fainted, caught her by the feet, pulled her
into the house and barred the door. She grasped a rifle
and told her husband, she would help him to fight. He
replied that he had been wounded and was dying. She
then presented the gun through several port holes in quick
succession&mdash;then calmly sat by her husband and closed
his eyes in death. You would conclude that the scene
ought to end here&mdash;but after waiting several hours, and
seeing nothing more of the Indians, she sallied out in desperation
to make her way to the White Oak Spring, with
her infant in her arms, and a son, three or four years of
age, following her. Afraid to pursue the trace, she entered
the woods, and after running till she was nearly exhausted
she came at length to the trace. She determined to follow
it at all hazards, and having advanced a few miles further,
she met the elder Mr. Duree, with his wife, and youngest son,
with their baggage, on their way to the new station. The
melancholy tidings induced them, of course, to return.
They led their horses into an adjoining canebrake, unloaded
them, and regained the White Oak Spring fort before daylight.</p>
<p>It is impossible at this day to make a just impression of
the sufferings of the pioneers about the period spoken of.
The White Oak Spring fort in 1782, with perhaps one
hundred souls in it, was reduced in August to three fighting
white men&mdash;and I can say with truth, that for two or three
weeks, my mother&#8217;s family never unclothed themselves to
sleep, nor were all of them, within the time, at their meals
together, nor was any household business attempted. Food
was prepared, and placed where those who chose could
eat. It was the period when Bryant&#8217;s station was besieged
and for many days before and after that gloomy event, we
were in constant expectation of being made prisoners.
We made application to Colonel Logan for a guard, and
obtained one, but not until the danger was measurably
over. It then consisted of two men only. Colonel Logan
did everything in his power, as county lieutenant, to sustain
the different forts&mdash;but it was not a very easy matter
to order a married man from a fort where his family was
to defend some other&mdash;when his own was in imminent
danger.</p>
<p>I went with my mother in January, 1783, to Logan&#8217;s
station, to prove my father&#8217;s will. He had fallen in the
preceding July. Twenty armed men were of the party.
Twenty-three widows were in attendance upon the court,
to obtain letters of administration on the estates of their
husbands, who had been killed during the past year. My
mother went to Colonel Logan&#8217;s, who received and treated
her like a sister.</p>

<p>The Chippewas are a numerous people inhabiting the

the Mississippi. They are divided into several tribes,
and are distinguished by the number of blue or black
lines tattooed on their cheeks and foreheads.</p>
<p>Travellers have always described them as &#8220;the most

THE SENTINEL.<br />

<p>In their pursuit of deer, they sometimes drive them
into the small lakes, and then spear them from their canoes;
or shoot them with the bow and arrow, after having
driven them into inclosures constructed for the purpose.
Snares made of deer sinews, too, are frequently used for
catching large and small game: and as these occupations
are not beyond the strength of the old men and boys,
they take a share in these toils, which among most of the
tribes are left exclusively to the squaws.</p>
<p>In person the Chippewas are not remarkable; they are
generally robust, their complexion swarthy, their features
broad, and their hair straight and black, which is the case
in most of the Indian tribes. But they have not that
piercing eye, which so generally animates the Indian
countenance.</p>
<p>The aspect of the women is more agreeable than that
of the men; they wear their hair of a great length, and
pay much attention to its arrangement, greasing it with
considerable taste.</p>
<p>They appear to be more attentive to the comforts of
dress, and less anxious about its exterior than of their red
brethren. Deer and fawn skins, dressed with the hair
on, so skilfully that they are perfectly supple, compose
their shirt or coat, which is girt round the waist with a
belt, and reaches half way down the thigh. Their moccasins
and leggins are generally sewn together, and the
latter meet the belt to which they are fastened. A ruff
or tippet surrounds the neck, and the skin of the deer&#8217;s
head is formed into a curious sort of cap.</p>
<p>A robe of several deer skins sewn together is throw
over the whole; this dress is sometimes worn single, but
in winter it is always made double, the hair forming both
the lining and the outside.</p>
<p>Thus attired, a Chippewa will lay himself down on the
snow and repose in comfort; and if in his wanderings
across the numerous lakes with which his country abounds,
he should fall short of provisions, he has only to cut a
hole in the ice, when he seldom fails of taking a blackfish,
or a bass, which he broils over his little wood fire
with as much skill as a French cook.</p>
<p>At the time of the French and Indian wars, the American
army was encamped on the Plains of Chippewa.
Colonel St. Clair, the commander, was a brave and meritorious
officer, but his bravery sometimes amounted to rashness,
and his enemies have accused him of indiscretion.
In the present instance perhaps he may have merited the
accusation, for the plain on which he had encamped was
bordered by a dense forest, from which the Indian scouts
could easily pick off his sentinels without in the least
exposing themselves to danger.</p>

CHIPPEWA INDIANS FISHING ON THE ICE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Five nights had passed, and every night the sentinel,
who stood at a lonely out-post in the vicinity of the forest,
had been shot; and these repeated disasters struck such
dread among the remaining soldiers, that no one would
come forward to offer to take the post, and the commander,
knowing it was only throwing men&#8217;s lives away,
let it stand for a few nights unoccupied.</p>
<p>At length, a rifleman of the Virginian corps, volunteered
his services for this dangerous duty; he laughed at the
fears of his companions, and told them he meant to return
safe and drink his commander&#8217;s health in the morning.
The guard marched up soon after, and he shouldered
his rifle and fell. He arrived at the place which had been
so fatal to his comrades, and bidding his fellow soldiers
&#8220;good night,&#8221; assumed the duties of his post. The night
was dark, thick clouds overspread the firmament, and
hardly a star could be seen by the sentinel as he paced
his lonely walk. All was silent except the gradually retreating
footsteps of the guard; he marched onwards,
then stopped and listened till he thought he heard the
joyful sound of &#8220;All&#8217;s well&#8221;&mdash;then all was still, and he
sat down on a fallen tree and began to muse. Presently
a low rustling among the bushes caught his ear; he gazed
intently towards the spot whence the sound seemed to
proceed, but he could see nothing save the impenetrable
gloom of the forest. The sound grew nearer, and a well-known
grunt informed him of the approach of a bear.
The animal passed the soldier slowly, and then quietly
sought the thicket to the left. At this moment the moon
shone out bright through the parting clouds, and the wary
soldier perceived the ornamented moccasin of a savage on
what an instant before he believed to be a bear! He
could have shot him in a moment, but he knew not how
many other animals might be at hand; he therefore refrained,
and having perfect knowledge of Indian subtilty,
he quickly took off his hat and coat, hung them on a
branch of a fallen tree, grasped his rifle, and silently
crept towards the thicket. He had barely reached it,
when an arrow, whizzing past his head, told him of the
danger he had so narrowly escaped.</p>
<p>He looked carefully round him, and on a little spot of
cleared land he counted twelve Indians, some sitting, some
lying full length on the thickly strewn leaves of the forest.
Believing that they had already shot the sentinel, and little
thinking there was any one within hearing, they were
quite off their guard, and conversed aloud about their
plans for the morrow.</p>
<p>It appeared that a council of twelve chiefs was now
held, in which they gravely deliberated on the most effectual
means of annoying the enemy. It was decided that
the next evening forty of their warriors should be in readiness
at the hour when the sentinel should be left by his
comrades, and that when they had retired a few paces, an
arrow should silence him for ever, and they would then
rush on and massacre the guard.</p>
<p>This being concluded, they rose, and drawing the numerous
folds of their ample robes closer round them, they
marched off in Indian file through the gloomy forest, seeking
some more distant spot, where the smoke of their nightly
fire would not be observed by the white men.</p>
<p>The sentinel rose from his hiding-place and returned to
his post, and taking down his hat, found that an arrow
had passed clean through it. He then wrapt himself in
his watch-coat, and returned immediately to the camp;
and without any delay demanded to speak to the commander,
saying that he had something important to communicate.</p>

GENERAL MORGAN.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>He was admitted, and when he had told all that he had
seen and heard, the Colonel bestowed on him the commission
of lieutenant of the Virginia corps, which had been
made vacant by the death of one of his comrades a few
nights back, and ordered him to be ready with a picket
guard, to march an hour earlier than usual to the fatal
out-post, there to place a hat and coat on the branches, and
then lie in ambush for the intruders.</p>
<p>The following evening, according to the orders given by
Colonel St. Clair, a detachment of forty riflemen, with
Lieutenant Morgan at their head, marched from the camp
at half past seven in the evening towards the appointed
spot, and having arranged the hat and coat so as to have
the appearance of a soldier standing on guard, they stole
silently away and hid themselves among the bushes.</p>
<p>Here they lay for almost an hour before any signs of
approaching Indians were heard. The night was cold
and still, and the rising moon shone forth in all her beauty.
The men were becoming impatient of their uncomfortable
situation, for their clothes were not so well adapted to a
bed of snow as the deer-skin robes of the hardy Chippewas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; whispered Lieutenant Morgan&mdash;&#8220;I hear the
rustling of the leaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently a bear of the same description as had been
seen the night before, passed near the ambush; it crept
to the edge of the plain&mdash;reconnoitred&mdash;saw the sentinel
at his post&mdash;retired towards the forest a few paces, and
then, suddenly rising on his feet, let fly an arrow which
brought the sham sentinel to the ground. So impatient
were the Virginians to avenge the death of their comrades
that they could scarcely wait till the lieutenant gave the
word of command to fire&mdash;then they rose in a body, and
before the Chippewas had time to draw their arrows or
seize their tomahawks, more than half their number lay
dead upon the plain. The rest fled to the forest, but the
riflemen fired again, and killed or wounded several more
of the enemy. They then returned in triumph to relate
their exploits in the camp.</p>
<p>Ten chiefs fell that night, and their fall was, undoubtedly,
one principal cause of the French and Indian wars with the
English.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Morgan rose to be a captain, and at the termination
of the war returned home, and lived on his own
farm till the breaking out of the American war. And
then, at the head of a corps of Virginia rifleman, appeared
our hero, the brave and gallant Colonel Morgan, better
known by the title of general, which he soon acquired by
his courage and ability.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
<h2>Blackbird.</h2>
</div>

<p>Among the first tribes of the Great Oregon Territory,
which established friendly intercourse with the United
States traders, were the Omahas. The boast of these Indians
was a chief named Blackbird, who was a steadfast friend
of the white men and the terror of the neighboring hostile
tribes. Such were his skill, courage, and success in war,
that friends and foes regarded him as enchanted. He delighted
in trials of strength or agility, in which he always
came off victorious. In addition to these qualities, he possessed
a secret which rendered him more than human in
the eyes of his barbarous followers. This was an acquaintance
with the properties of arsenic, which he had obtained
from a white trader. Whenever he was displeased with an
Indian, he prophesied his death before a certain day, and
the sure accomplishment of the prophecy rendered Blackbird
an object of terror and reverence.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the Poncas made an incursion into
Blackbird&#8217;s territory, and carried away a number of women
and horses. He immediately collected his warriors and
pursued them. The Poncas sheltered themselves behind
a rude embankment, but their persevering enemy, gaining
a good position, poured upon them a well-directed fire,
which did fearful execution. The Ponca chief dispatched
a herald, with the calumet, but he was immediately shot;
a second herald experienced the same treatment. The
chieftain&#8217;s daughter, a young maiden of much personal
beauty, then appeared before the stern foe, dressed with
exquisite taste, and bearing the calumet. Blackbird&#8217;s
heart softened, he accepted the sacred emblem, and concluded
a peace with his enemy. The pledge given and
received was the beautiful Ponca maiden, as wife to the
fierce chieftain of Omaha.</p>
<p>For the first time the heart of Blackbird felt the genial
influence of love. He loved the young creature who had
saved her tribe, with all the ardor of untutored nature.
But he was still a savage, and sometimes ungovernable
bursts of rage would transport him beyond all bounds of
affection or decency. In one of these, his beloved wife
unwittingly offended him. He instantly drew his knife
and laid her dead with a single blow. The dreadful deed
calmed him in a moment. For a little while he looked at
the beautiful corpse in stupid grief, and then, with his head
wrapped in his robe, he sat down beside it. He ate no
food, spake no word for three days. The remonstrances
of his people were received with silence, and no one dared
to uncover his face. At length one of them brought in a
small child, and placed the foot of the unhappy warrior
on its neck. Blackbird was moved by the significant appeal
and throwing aside his robe, he arose and delivered an
oration.</p>
<p>The Omaha tribe were greatly thinned by small-pox,
and to this loathsome disease their great chieftain fell a
victim. His dying request was bold and fanciful. Near
the source of the Missouri is a high solitary rock, round
which the river winds in a nearly circular direction, and
which commands a view of the adjacent country for many
miles around. There Blackbird had often sat to watch for
the canoes of the white traders, and there it was his dying
request to be buried. He was to be mounted upon his
horse, completely armed, so as to overlook his lands, and
watch for the coming boat of the white men. His orders
were obeyed; and on that same high promontory, over the
tomb of the Indian warrior was raised his national banner,
capped with the scalps which he had taken in battle. Of
course the Indians regard the rock with superstitious reverence,
and have their own stories of the scenes which
occasionally take place on and around it.</p>

<h2>A Desperate Adventure.</h2>
</div>

<p>While encamped on the 24th of April, at a spring near
the Spanish Trail, we were surprised by the sudden appearance
amongst us of two Mexicans; a man and a boy.
The name of the man was Andreas Fuentas, and that of
the boy, a handsome lad of eleven years old, Pablo Hernandez.
With a cavalcade of about thirty horses, they
had come out from Puebla de los Angelos, near the Pacific;
had lost half their animals, stolen by the Indians,
and now sought my camp for aid. Carson and Godey,
two of my men, volunteered to pursue them, with the
Mexican; and, well mounted, the three set off on the
trail. In the evening, Fuentas returned, his horse having
failed; but Carson and Godey had continued the pursuit.</p>

KIT. CARSON.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day, a war-whoop was
heard, such as Indians make when returning from a victorious
enterprise; and soon Carson and Godey appeared
driving before them a band of horses, recognised by Fuentas
to be a part of those they had lost. Two bloody
scalps, dangling from the end of Godey&#8217;s gun, announced
that they had overtaken the Indians as well as the horses.
They had continued the pursuit alone after Fuentas left
them, and towards nightfall entered the mountains into
which the trail led. After sunset, the moon gave light
until late in the night, when it entered a narrow defile,
and was difficult to follow. Here they lay from midnight
till morning. At daylight they resumed the pursuit, and
at sunrise discovered the horses; and immediately dismounting
and tying up their own, they crept cautiously
to a rising ground which intervened, from the crest of
which they perceived the encampment of four lodges close
by. They proceeded quietly, and got within thirty or
forty yards of their object, when a movement among the
horses discovered them to the Indians. Giving the war
shout, they instantly charged into the camp, regardless
of the numbers which the four lodges might contain. The
Indians received them with a flight of arrows, shot from
their long bows, one of which passed through Godey&#8217;s
shirt collar, barely missing the neck. Our men fired their
rifles upon a steady aim, and rushed in. Two Indians
were stretched upon the ground, fatally pierced with
bullets; the rest fled, except a lad, who was captured. The
scalps of the fallen were instantly stripped off, but in the
process, one of them, who had two balls through his body,
sprung to his feet, the blood streaming from his skinned
head, and uttered a hideous howl. The frightful spectacle
appalled the stout hearts of our men; but they did what
humanity required, and quickly terminated the agony of
the gory savage. They were now masters of the camp,
which was a pretty little recess in the mountain, with a
fine spring, and apparently safe from all invasion. Great
preparation had been made for feasting a large party, for
it was a very proper place for a rendezvous, and for the
celebration of such orgies as robbers of the desert would
delight in. Several of the horses had been killed, skinned,
and cut up&mdash;for the Indians living in the mountains, and
only coming into the plains to rob and murder, make no
other use of horses than to eat them. Large earthen
vessels were on the fire, boiling and stewing the horse
beef, and several baskets containing fifty or sixty pair of
moccasins, indicated the presence or expectation of a large
party. They released the boy who had given strong
evidence of the stoicism, or something else of the savage
character, by commencing his breakfast upon a horse&#8217;s
head as soon as he found he was not to be killed, but only
tied as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Their object accomplished, our men gathered up all the
surviving horses, fifteen in number, returned upon their
trail, and rejoined us at our camp in the afternoon of the
same day. They had rode about one hundred miles in
the pursuit and return, and all in about thirty hours. The
time, place, object and numbers considered, this expedition
of Carson and Godey may be considered among the
boldest and most disinterested which the annals of western
adventure, so full of daring deeds, can present. Two
men in a savage wilderness, pursue day and night an unknown
body of Indians into the defiles of an unknown
mountain&mdash;attack them on sight without counting numbers&mdash;and
defeat them in an instant&mdash;and for what?&mdash;to
punish the robbers of the desert, and revenge the wrongs
of Mexicans whom they did not know. I repeat it was
Carson and Godey who did this&mdash;the former an American,
born, in Booneslick county, Missouri; the latter a Frenchman,
born in St. Louis&mdash;and both trained to western
enterprise from early life.</p>

<h2>Adventure of Two Scouts.</h2>
</div>

<p>As early as the year 1790, the block-house and stockade,
above the mouth of the Hockhocking river, was a
frontier post for the hardy pioneer of that portion of the
state from the Hockhocking to the Sciota, and from the
Ohio river to the northern lakes. Then nature wore her
undisturbed livery of dark and thick forests, interspersed
with green and flowery prairies. Then the axe of the
woodman had not been heard in the wilderness, nor the
plough of the husbandmen marred the beauty of the green
prairies. Among the rich and luxuriant valleys, that of
the Hockhocking was pre-eminent for nature&#8217;s richest
gifts&mdash;and the portico of it whereon Lancaster now stands,
was marked as the most luxuriant and picturesque, and
became the seat of an Indian village, at a period so early,
that the &#8220;memory of man runneth not parallel thereto.&#8221;
On the green sward of the prairie was held many a rude
gambol of the Indians; and here, too, was many an assemblage
of the warriors of one of the most powerful
tribes, taking counsel for a &#8220;war-path,&#8221; upon some weak
or defenceless post.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 495px;'>
THE BLOCK-HOUSE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Upon one of these stirring occasions, intelligence
reached the little garrison above the mouth of the Hockhocking,
that the Indians were gathering in force somewhere
up the valley, for the purpose of striking a terrible
and fatal blow on one of the few and scattered defences
of the whites. A council was held by the garrison, and
scouts were sent up the Hockhocking, in order to ascertain
the strength of the foe, and the probable point of attack.
In the month of October, and on one of the balmiest days
of our Indian summer, two men could have been seen
emerging out of the thick plumb and hazel bushes skirting
the prairie, and stealthily climbing the eastern declivity
of that most remarkable promontory, now known as Mount
Pleasant, whose western summit gives a commanding view
to the eye of what is doing on the prairie. This eminence
was gained by our two adventurers and hardy scouts, and
from this point they carefully observed the movements
taking place on the prairie. Every day brought an accession
of warriors to those already assembled, and every day
the scouts witnessed from their eyrie, the horse-racing,
leaping, running and throwing the deadly tomahawk by
the warriors. The old sachems looking on with indifference&mdash;the
squaws, for the most part, engaged in their
usual drudgeries, and the papooses manifesting all the
noisy and wayward joy of childhood. The arrival of any
new party of savages was hailed by the terrible war-whoop,
which striking the mural face of Mount Pleasant, was driven
back into the various indentations of the surrounding hills,
producing reverberation on reverberation, and echo on
echo, till it seemed as if ten thousand fiends were gathered
in their orgies. Such yells might well strike terror into
the bosoms of those unaccustomed to them. To our scouts
these were but martial music strains which waked their
watchfulness, and strung their iron frames. From their
early youth had they been always on the frontier, and
therefore well practised in all the subtlety, craft, and
cunning, as well as knowing the ferocity and bloodthirsty
perseverance of the savage. They were therefore not
likely to be circumvented by the cunning of their foes;
and without a desperate struggle, would not fall victims
to the scalping-knife.</p>
<p>On several occasions, small parties of warriors left the
prairies and ascended the Mount; at which times the
scouts would hide in the fissures of the rocks, or lying by
the side of some long prostrate tree, cover themselves
with the sear and yellow leaf, and again leave their hiding
places when their uninvited visitors had disappeared.</p>

A SHAWANESE WARRIOR.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>For food they depended on jerked venison, and cold corn
bread, with which their knapsacks had been well stored.
Fire they dared not kindle, and the report of one of their
rifles would bring upon them the entire force of the Indians.
For drink they depended on some rain water,
which still stood in excavations of the rocks, but in a few
days this store was exhausted, and M&#8217;Clelland and White
must abandon their enterprise or find a new supply. To
accomplish this most hazardous affair, M&#8217;Clelland being
the elder, resolved to make the attempt&mdash;with his trusty
rifle in his grasp, and two canteens strung across his
shoulders, he cautiously descended to the prairie, and
skirting the hills on the north as much as possible within
the hazel thickets, he struck a course for the Hockhocking
river. He reached its margin, and turning an abrupt
point of a hill, he found a beautiful fountain of limpid
water, now known as the Cold Spring, within a few feet
of the river. He filled his canteens and returned in
safety to his watchful companion. It was now determined
to have a fresh supply of water every day, and this duty
was to be performed alternately.</p>
<p>On one of these occasions, after White had filled his
canteens, he sat a few moments, watching the limpid element,
as it came gurgling out of the bosom of the earth&mdash;the
light sound of footsteps caught his practised ear, and
upon turning round, he saw two squaws within a few feet
of him; these upon turning the jet of the hill had thus
suddenly came upon him. The elder squaw gave one of
those far-reaching whoops peculiar to the Indians. White
at once comprehended his perilous situation&mdash;for if the
alarm should reach the camp, he and his companion must
inevitably perish. Self-preservation impelled him to inflict
a noiseless death upon the squaws, and in such a
manner as to leave no trace behind. Ever rapid in
thought, and prompt in action, he sprang upon his victims
with a rapidity and power of a panther, and grasping
the throat of each, with one bound he sprang into the
river, and rapidly thrust the head of the elder woman
under the water, and making stronger efforts to submerge
the younger, who, however, powerfully resisted. During
the short struggle, the younger female addressed him in
his own language, though almost in inarticulate sounds.
Releasing his hold, she informed him, that, ten years before,
she had been made a prisoner, on Grave Creek flats,
and that the Indians, in her presence, butchered her mother
and two sisters; and that an only brother had been
captured with her, who succeeded on the second night in
making his escape; but what had become of him she
knew not.</p>
<p>During the narrative, White, unobserved by the girl,
had let go his grasp on the elder squaw, whose body soon
floated where it would not, probably soon be found. He
now directed the girl hastily to follow him, and with his
usual energy and speed, pushed for the Mount. They had
scarcely gone two hundred yards from the spring, before
the alarm cry was heard some quarter of a mile down the
stream. It was supposed that some warriors returning
from a hunt, struck the Hockhocking just as the body of
the drowned squaw floated past. White and the girl succeeded
in reaching the Mount, where M&#8217;Clelland had been
no indifferent spectator to the sudden commotion among
the Indians, as the prairie warriors were seen to strike off
in every direction, and before White and the girl had arrived,
a party of some twenty warriors had already gained
the eastern acclivity of the Mount, and were cautiously
ascending, carefully keeping under cover. Soon the two
scouts saw the swarthy faces of the foe, as they glided from
tree to tree, and rock to rock, until the whole base of the
Mount was surrounded, and all hopes of escape were cut off.</p>

<p>In this peril nothing was left, other than to sell their
lives as dearly as possible; this they resolved to do, and
advised the girl to escape to the Indians, and tell them
she had been a captive to the scouts.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;No! Death, and that in presence of my
people, is to me a thousand times sweeter than captivity&mdash;furnish
me with a rifle, and I will show you that I can
fight as well as die. This spot I leave not! here my
bones shall lie bleaching with yours! and should either
of you escape, you will carry the tidings of my death to
my remaining relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remonstrance proved fruitless; the two scouts matured
their plans for a vigorous defence&mdash;opposing
craft to craft, expedient to expedient, and an unerring
fire of the deadly rifle. The attack now commenced in
front, where, from the narrow backbone of the Mount,
the savages had to advance in single file, but where they
could avail themselves of the rock and trees. In advancing
the warrior must be momentarily exposed, and two
bare inches of his swarthy form was target enough for
the unerring rifle of the scouts. After bravely maintaining
the fight in front, and keeping the enemy in check,
they discovered a new danger threatening them. The
wary foe now made every preparation to attack them in
flank, which could be most successfully and fatally done
by reaching an insulated rock lying in one of the ravines
on the southern hill side. This rock once gained
by the Indians, they could bring the scouts under point
blank shot of the rifle; and without the possibility of
escape.</p>
<p>Our brave scouts saw the hopelessness of their situation,
which nothing could avert but brave companions and
an unerring shot&mdash;them they had not. But the brave
never despair. With this certain fate resting upon them,
they had continued as calm, and as calculating, and
as unwearied as the strongest desire of vengeance on a
treacherous foe could produce. Soon M&#8217;Clelland saw a
tall and swarthy figure preparing to spring from a cover
so near the fatal rock, that a single bound must reach
it, and all hope be destroyed. He felt that all depended
on one advantageous shot, although but one inch of the
warrior&#8217;s body was exposed, and that at a distance of one
hundred yards&mdash;he resolved to risk all&mdash;coolly he raised
his rifle to his eyes, carefully shading the sight with his
hand, he drew a bead so sure, that he felt conscious it
would do&mdash;he touched the hair trigger with his finger&mdash;the
hammer came down, but in place of striking fire, it
crushed his flint into a hundred fragments! Although he
felt that the savage must reach the fatal rock before he
could adjust another flint, he proceeded to the task with
the utmost composure, casting many a furtive glance
towards the fearful point. Suddenly he saw the warrior
stretching every muscle for the leap&mdash;and with the agility
of a deer he made the spring&mdash;instead of reaching the rock
he sprung ten feet in the air, and giving one terrific yell
he fell upon the earth, and his dark corpse rolled fifty feet
down the hill. He had evidently received a death shot
from some unknown hand. A hundred voices from below
re-echoed the terrible shout, and it was evident that they
had lost a favorite warrior, as well as been foiled for a time
in their most important movement. A very few moments
proved that the advantage so mysteriously gained would
be of short duration; for already the scouts caught a momentary
glimpse of a swarthy warrior, cautiously advancing
towards the cover so recently occupied by a fellow companion.
Now, too, the attack in front was resumed with
increased fury, so as to require the incessant fire of both
scouts, to prevent the Indians from gaining the eminence&mdash;and
in a short time M&#8217;Clelland saw the wary warrior turning
a somerset, his corpse rolled down towards his companion:
again a mysterious agent had interposed in their
behalf. This second sacrifice cast dismay into the ranks
of the assailants; and just as the sun was disappearing
behind the western hills, the foe withdrew a short distance,
for the purpose of devising new modes of attack. The respite
came most seasonably to the scouts, who had bravely
kept their position, and boldly maintained the unequal
fight from the middle of the day.</p>

THE SCOUT.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Now, for the first time, was the girl missing, and the
scouts supposed through terror she had escaped to her
former captors, or that she had been killed during the
fight. They were not long left to doubt, for in a few
moments the girl was seen emerging from behind a rock
and coming to them with a rifle in her hand.</p>
<p>During the heat of the fight she saw a warrior fall, who
had advanced some fifty yards before the main body in
front. She at once resolved to possess herself of his rifle,
and crouching in undergrowth she crept to the spot, and
succeeded in her enterprise, being all the time exposed to
the cross fire of the defenders and assailants&mdash;her practised
eye had early noticed the fatal rock, and hers was
the mysterious hand by which the two warriors had fallen&mdash;the
last being the most wary, untiring, and bloodthirsty
brave of the Shawnese tribe. He it was, who ten years
previous had scalped the family of the girl, and been her
captor.</p>
<p>In the west, dark clouds were now gathering, and in
an hour the whole heavens were shrouded in them; this
darkness greatly embarrassed the scouts in their contemplated
night retreat, for they might readily lose their
way, or accidentally fall on the enemy&mdash;this being highly
probable, if not inevitable. An hour&#8217;s consultation decided
their plans, and it was agreed that the girl, from
her intimate knowledge of their localities, should lead the
advance a few steps. Another advantage might be gained
by this arrangement, for in case they should fall in with
some out-post, the girl&#8217;s knowledge of the Indian tongue,
would, perhaps, enable her to deceive the sentinel: and
so the sequel proved, for scarcely had they descended one
hundred feet, when a low &#8220;whist&#8221; from the girl, warned
them of present danger.</p>

THE RETURNED CAPTIVE.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The scouts sunk silently to the earth, where, by previous
agreement, they were to remain till another signal
was given them by the girl,&mdash;whose absence for more
than a quarter of an hour now began to excite the most
serious apprehensions. At length, she again appeared,
and told them that she had succeeded in removing two
sentinels who were directly in their route to a point some
hundred feet distant. The descent was noiselessly resumed&mdash;the
level gained, and the scouts followed their
intrepid pioneer for half a mile in the most profound
silence, when the barking of a small dog, within a few
feet, apprised them of a new danger. The almost simultaneous
click of the scouts&#8217; rifles was heard by the girl,
who rapidly approached them, and stated that they were
now in the midst of the Indian wigwams, and their lives
depended on the most profound silence, and implicitly
following her footsteps. A moment afterwards, the
girl was accosted by a squaw, from an opening in the
wigwam. She replied in the Indian language, and without
stopping pressed forward.</p>
<p>In a short time she stopped and assured the scouts
that the village was cleared and that they were now in
safety. She knew that every pass leading out of the
prairie was safely guarded by Indians, and at once resolved
to adopt the bold adventure of passing through
the very centre of their village as the least hazardous.
The result proved the correctness of her judgment.</p>
<p>They now kept a course for the Ohio, being guided by
the Hockhocking river&mdash;and after three days&#8217; march and
suffering, the party arrived at the block-house in safety.</p>
<p>Their escape from the Indians, prevented the contemplated
attack; and the rescued girl proved to be the sister
of the intrepid Neil Washburn, celebrated in Indian warfare
as the renowned scout to Captain Kenton&#8217;s bloody
Kentuckians.</p>

<h2>A Young Hero of the West.</h2>
</div>

<p>To show of what material the boys were made, in the
great heroic age of the west, we give the following, which
we find in a recent communication from Major Nye, of
Ohio. The scene of adventure was within the present
limits of Wood county, Virginia.</p>
<p>I have heard from Mr. Guthrie and others, that at Bellville
a man had a son, quite a youth, say twelve or fourteen
years of age, who had been used to firing his father&#8217;s
gun, as most boys did in those days. He heard, he supposed,
turkeys on or near the bank of the Ohio, opposite
that place, and asked his father to let him take his gun
and kill one. His father knowing that the Indians often
decoyed people by such noises, refused, saying it was
probably an Indian. When he had gone to work, the
boy took the gun and paddled his canoe over the river,
but had the precaution to land some distance from where
he had heard the turkey all the morning, probably from
fear of scaring the game, and perhaps a little afraid of
Indians. The banks were steep, and the boy cautiously
advanced to where he could see without being seen.
Watching awhile for his game, he happened to see an
Indian cautiously looking over a log, to notice where the
boy had landed. The lad fixed his gun at rest, watching
the place where he had seen the Indian&#8217;s head, and when
it appeared again, fired, and the Indian disappeared.
The boy dropped the gun and ran for his canoe, which he
paddled over the river as soon as possible. When he
reached home, he said, &#8220;Mother, I have killed an Indian!&#8221;
and the mother replied, &#8220;No, you have not.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; said the boy. The father coming in, he
made the same report to him, and received the same reply;
but he constantly affirmed it was even so; and, as
the gun was left, a party took the boy over the river to
find it, and show the place where he shot the Indian, and
behold, his words were found verified. The ball had entered
the head, where the boy had affirmed he shot,
between the eye and ear.</p>
